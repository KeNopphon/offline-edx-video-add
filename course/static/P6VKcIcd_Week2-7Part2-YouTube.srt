How to Act as
Engineer on site 2

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,012
During launch sequence at stage 4, Mr. Boisjoly

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
took the action to consult

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
and suggest the problem

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
to his bosses many

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
times. Also,

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
he asked his
colleagues in NASA

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
to persuade the management

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
of Morton-Thiokol Inc.

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
Furthermore,
he wrote a detailed

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
daily log of his experience

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
as well as his
rising resentment.

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
The diary was regarded

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
as a significant evidence

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
in the post-disaster
investigation

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
committee formed by

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,059
the President Regan.

1
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:15,272
So, there are various theories, 

2
00:00:15,272 --> 00:00:17,324
let's pick up on example

3
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:20,482
psychological well-being, which is

4
00:00:20,482 --> 00:00:26,005
proposed by Carol Riff from Wisconsin University,

5
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:30,001
says there are six aspects,

6
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,560
the other example is from Gallup,

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,939
which conducts statics across the world,

8
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,716
we use their data,

9
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:42,454
well-being Tom Ruth proposes,

10
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:45,772
it is like inclusive well-being.

11
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:49,888
well-being begins from carrier,

12
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:51,889
to community.

13
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:53,564
This is he proposed.

14
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:56,020
We can see more idea about well-being,

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:02,948
the most powerful and popular model 

16
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:05,755
among us is 

17
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:09,271
Segliman's PERMA model.

18
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:14,584
Segliman says well-being is a concept,

19
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:20,174
so we cannot measure it with one index.

20
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:22,773
For example,

21
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:24,764
just as we cannot judge the weather in Tokyo

22
00:01:24,764 --> 00:01:28,869
with one index,

23
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:30,830
No one cannot measure well-being 

24
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,699
with one index. However,

25
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:41,200
I think there would be a factor structuring well-being.

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,016
I think it is measurable.

27
00:01:45,016 --> 00:01:49,771
There might be 

28
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:52,552
some measurable factors of well-being

29
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:57,214
at least, there are five, 

30
00:01:57,214 --> 00:01:59,057
according to Segliman.

31
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:01,936
One is Positive emotion, fun, happy,

32
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:04,091
comfortable, something like that.

33
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:07,158
People feel well-being 

34
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:10,206
when they are fun, happy, and comfortable 

35
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:12,982
I think.

36
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:17,744
And then, let's talk about ebgagement, 

37
00:02:17,744 --> 00:02:20,844
this word also cannot fit any Japanese words, 

38
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:28,464
like immersion, people concentrate on work

39
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:32,127
forgetting time, concentrate on sports or artistic activities,

40
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:37,566
when people concentrate on something, 

41
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:40,502
that is the situation he called engagement. 

42
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:44,155
People feel happiness during engagement.

43
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:46,861
So called in flow,

44
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:49,847
in zone for athlete.

45
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:51,697
the situation like that.

46
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:54,678
This relates to well-being.

47
00:02:54,678 --> 00:03:00,056
Third, about positive relationships,

48
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:02,173
that is human relationships.

49
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:05,984
when people have worries, 

50
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:08,854
some call to someone at 3 midnight.

51
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:11,517
Or when people have their friends  

52
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:14,782
who they can share fun,happiness,

53
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:18,215
or comfort with,

54
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:20,190
they feel well-being.

55
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,442
Absolutely right.

56
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:26,391
And move on to fourth, this is important,

57
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:32,171
Meaning, this is gained 

58
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:36,719
when people contribute to someone precious fot them,

59
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,275
well-being is

60
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:45,683
It is said that 

61
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,229
satisfaction is an important factor.

62
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:52,877
In the end, about achievement.

63
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:56,393
achieving something, whatever,

64
00:03:56,393 --> 00:04:02,609
job, or making plastic models,

65
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,229
and complete them, this is

66
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:07,175
a kind of achievement.

67
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:09,314
It is said that 

68
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:13,274
achievement relates to well-being much.

69
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:18,314
The most important factor is meaning,

70
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:22,634
according to some expertise, what do you think.

71
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:26,730
Do you Mr. Kono think 

72
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,514
you can gain well-being 

73
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,985
when you contribute to someone

74
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:34,772
precious.

75
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:38,734
I think it is convincible that meaning 

76
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:41,599
relates to hapiness when you can believe

77
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,530
your action or your existence has meanings.

78
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,677
According to an investigation,

79
00:04:47,677 --> 00:04:52,604
People who are satisfied with their life has high number of meaning,

80
00:04:52,604 --> 00:04:54,596
that is, they feel meaning strongly.

81
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:57,103
right.

82
00:04:57,103 --> 00:05:05,238
Also, meaning is larger than well-being

83
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,547
and it affects longer period,

84
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:12,081
Positive psychology revealed 

85
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:16,006
these outcomes.

86
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:19,561
Based on that, 

87
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:22,896
I could say,

88
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:25,396
as I told,

89
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:29,088
Principle of technicians is public safe, health,

90
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:32,613
and contribution to welfare, we should focus on these.

91
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:36,445
This is a roll model 

92
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:38,709
made by people around the world.

93
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:43,367
People who can follow the principle can be

94
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:46,059
a ethical technician.

95
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,684
I think.

96
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:50,283
And, positive psychology,

97
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,987
scientific outcomes of positive psychology

98
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:57,282
showed meaning, that is,

99
00:05:57,282 --> 00:06:00,902
contributing to someone precious,

100
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:05,427
it can give people well-being , 

101
00:06:05,427 --> 00:06:08,367
which lasts long time 

102
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,123
and strongly.

103
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:15,353
Scientific study revealed this.

104
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:17,263
so, principle in the beginning,

105
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:20,145
the rule and the outcome tell us

106
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:23,383
something that

107
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:29,809
technicians can give bigger welfare

108
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:35,084
by working with ethic,

109
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:36,919
providing well-being,

110
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,866
They themselves can live better,

111
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,192
I mean they can be happier.

112
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,973
I can say that.

113
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:48,405
This is the engineering ethic 2.0

114
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:51,754
This is the new idea of engineering ethic,

115
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:54,108
what do you think, Mr. Kono.

116
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:57,175
It is way better than version 1.0 (laughing)

117
00:06:57,175 --> 00:07:00,837
I think I can be motivated.

118
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,290
It's my pleasure.

119
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,922
Thank you for your comment.

120
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:08,890
Ok, then let's summarize 

121
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,075
what I talked in the second half.

122
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,848
First, ethics does not mean you do not do this,

123
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:17,758
do not do that, like preventive ethics,

124
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:20,321
it means  live better and happier.

125
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:22,663
what is well-being,

126
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:25,450
what can I do,

127
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,120
it is important to think these things

128
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,989
to behave.

129
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:34,384
Moreover,

130
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:37,805
ethics is 

131
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:42,178
aspirational ethics.

132
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:45,568
knowledge and ability to judge are for engineers,

133
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:50,990
or for their relatives,

134
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:57,031
marginal, for example, 

135
00:07:57,031 --> 00:08:01,227
neither application nor app,

136
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:04,060
I know we need  superior

137
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,033
app to work well, though, 

138
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,913
what for you do it,

139
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:14,570
relating to OS systems,

140
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,092
even if you have good apps,

141
00:08:18,092 --> 00:08:19,804
you cannot work well without OS.

142
00:08:19,804 --> 00:08:22,501
right.

143
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,359
So ethics is like 

144
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:28,041
core talent of engineers,in other word, 

145
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:33,540
it is like OS.

146
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,602
And,

147
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:41,989
principle of engineering ethics, public safety, 

148
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:46,790
health, welfare, this is ethical engineer,

149
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,842
from the perspective of positive psychology,

150
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:53,491
people can gain  well-being

151
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,194
when they have meaningful work,

152
00:08:56,194 --> 00:09:00,398
contribute to someone precious,

153
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:04,775
subjective and long lasting well-being,

154
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:07,422
that is, by working with ethics,

155
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,292
people can give their contribution and welfare to society,

156
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:13,183
and they themselves can be happier,

157
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:15,005
live better.

158
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:17,376
This is what I want you to remind 

159
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:20,932
through this lecture.

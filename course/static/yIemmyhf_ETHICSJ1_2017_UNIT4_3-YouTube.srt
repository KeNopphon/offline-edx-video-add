1
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:15,154
At last, in October 1972, Honda made an announcement


2
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:17,900
about their CVCC engine, which was designed to satisfy

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,937
the requirements of the Muskie Act.

4
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:24,921
In December of the same year,

5
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:28,405
it would undergo testing by the US EPA,

6
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:31,610
which formally announced in March 1973 that


7
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,853
the CVCC engine was compatible 

8
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:38,701
with the Muskie Act.

9
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,189
Honda had thus achieved something

10
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:44,485
considered impossible by the Big Three

11
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:46,586
and other major automakers.

12
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:52,967
And not only that, Honda also shared


13
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:57,071
the technology with other automakers,


14
00:00:57,071 --> 00:01:03,280
which was a huge leap forward


15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,627
in the initiative to reduce emissions.

16
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:13,101
So that is why we can look up today


17
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:17,039
and see the blue sky that we do.

18
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:20,302
The Honda Civic, which used this engine,


19
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:22,994
succeeded worldwide because of its

20
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:25,265
fuel economy and environmental considerations,

21
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:26,763
and introduced the whole world to Honda’s


22
00:01:26,763 --> 00:01:29,337
technological prowess. In 2000, the Civic


23
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:33,017
was the only Japanese entry in a readers’ poll


24
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:36,452
by the American Society of Automotive Engineers 

25
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:41,206
of the most technologically advanced cars 

26
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:44,854
of the 20th century.

27
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,226
The CVCC engine transformed what was


28
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:49,084
just another Japanese company into

29
00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:51,862
the Honda that the world knows today.

30
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:57,557
Exactly. And at the time, I was


31
00:01:57,557 --> 00:01:58,463
in between high school and college,

32
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:00,877
and for us, the Civic,

33
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:03,758
equipped with Honda’s CVCC engine,

34
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:11,846
was our dream car. Well, this period was

35
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:16,756
Sōichiro HONDA’s last years,

36
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:18,532
about which he has this to say:

37
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:24,469
“For me, the CVCC project was the ideal chance

38
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:27,104
to develop a low-emission engine would put me

39
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:31,041
on the map with the four leading automakers.

40
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,342
“But when young engineers spoke of the exhaust problem


41
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:38,277
not as a company issue, but rather as a problem

42
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:41,730
that the auto industry had a social responsibility 

43
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,587
to solve, and insisted that this was their duty,

44
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:47,482
it opened my eyes and moved me deeply.

45
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:49,889
“Everyone has grown up so fast. We have

46
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,680
entered a new era that requires a new kind of 


47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,277
management, built upon new values like these

48
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,732
that have opened my eyes, and a fresh take

49
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:02,545
on the relationship between companies and society.”

50
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:06,888
This is how he felt. Soon after this,


51
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:12,916
Mr. Honda would pass the baton to his successor.

52
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:17,056
The development of the CVCC engine saved Honda

53
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:21,896
from its management crisis. But it would not have 

54
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:28,251
been possible without the engineers’ belief


55
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:32,572
that it was the auto industry’s social responsibility

56
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:35,687
to “leave blue skies for our children.”

57
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:39,841
The CVCC engine is, for me, an excellent example, 


58
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:44,274
that reflects the need to be aware of 

59
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:49,515
environmental values; of the social responsibility 

60
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:52,566
of companies and engineers; and of the fact that 

61
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:59,509
the stakeholders of a technology 

62
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:03,634
are not only its providers and users,

63
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:06,997
but the whole society and the next generation too.

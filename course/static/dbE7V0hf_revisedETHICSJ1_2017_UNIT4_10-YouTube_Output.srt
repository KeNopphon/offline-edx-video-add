1
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:15,315
Even more, in buisiness field.

2
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,752
Positive psychology is used.

3
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:22,890
Called Zappos, on the
internet, originally

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,325
there is a company
which sells shoes,

5
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,761
it has developed like
skyscraper.

6
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:33,767
The CEO of the company,
Tony Jay

7
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:38,639
runs the company using
positive psychology

8
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,408
and it leads the company's
sccess clearly.

9
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,611
Let's see Google

10
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:49,616
Google has Google University in
their company for employees' training

11
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:54,221
In the system,

12
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:58,091
the most popular subject is

13
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,360
the program, called Search
Inside Yourself

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,895
Eh,

15
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,098
This is also

16
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,734
based on positive psychology.

17
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:12,272
Moreover, local government
also tries to use

18
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,574
positive psychology,

19
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,844
I heard.

20
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,380
In Australia,

21
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,783
you know the state
of south Australia,

22
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,085
of which Adelede
is the capital.

23
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,287
Then The state of
South Australia,

24
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:31,758
Dr. Seligman visited there, and

25
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,796
the problem the state has,
actually industrial structure

26
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,197
is changing slowly

27
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,967
To solve the problem,

28
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,735
I asked him

29
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,603
what I can do.

30
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:48,442
Then he proposed

31
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:54,081
to make strategies to increase
well-being in entire state,

32
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:57,351
the government should
lead those strategies.

33
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:00,420
That what he said to me, and
I proposed his idea to the government.

34
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,825
Then, the state of
south Australia

35
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:08,762
made a lab tomeasuring
well-being and resilience,

36
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,966
they actually measured
well being

37
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,737
and decided to take in
positive education,

38
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,406
which is based on
positive psychology,

39
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:23,844
they launched some actual strategies to 
increase well-being in entire of the state.

40
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:29,549
This is a report made by

41
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,786
officials in Great Britain,

42
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:38,025
including various
good practices

43
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,261
about training of mindfulness.

44
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:45,732
The report says with these good
practices supported by science

45
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,102
they try to increase well-being

46
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,706
in Great Britain.

47
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:57,244
In addition, the United Nations
set World Happy Day

48
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,781
on March 20, in 2011.

49
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:05,385
After 2011, almost every year,

50
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:12,025
countries participating in the
United Nation measure their well-being

51
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:18,365
and apply the data to their
strategy making.

52
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,501
That's what the report meant.

53
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,004
This is the latest
investigation,

54
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:29,576
the data of well-being from 2013
to 2015 is on it, though,

55
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:34,314
Sadly, Japan is on 53th
(laughing).

56
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:40,053
Achievement of the study about
positive psychology is

57
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,422
used for various purpose.

58
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,324
I think that is true. However,

59
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,793
Are there any theory about
well-being or hapiness

60
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:51,131
already?

61
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,367
Are there any theory systems?

62
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:58,805
As I told you,

63
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,075
The study about
well-being started

64
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,480
just 10 years ago.

65
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,919
Therefore, there have not
been theories and models,

66
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,225
like anyone can accept.

67
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:21,428
Mr. Kono, sorry for
asking suddenly,

68
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,263
I heard you studied the
history of science as well.

69
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,567
Do you know what
Aristotle believed

70
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,936
cosmo was made by?

71
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,073
Or,where Aristle believed
the center of cosmo.

72
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:37,344
Do you remember that.

73
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,814
Aristle devided ceiling
into ground,

74
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:44,284
he said ground is made by soil,
water, air, and fire,

75
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,688
so called the classical
element theory,

76
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,392
and he thought the center
of cosmo is the Earth.

77
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:57,497
Exactly, that's right.
And his thought

78
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,300
is told in Greece and Rome

79
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,235
even after Alistle passed,

80
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,772
when the first University
in Europe appeared,

81
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,276
his thought was told
to people to people.

82
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:13,413
But, in 16th or 17th century,
when Gallireo and Newton

83
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,650
made contemporaly science,

84
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:24,124
people started thinking about
cosmo for the first time after Aristle.

85
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,027
That means people finally
started studying cosmo

86
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:30,797
scientifically. After 400
or 500 years passed,

87
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,466
finally we are getting closer to
the answer of birth of cosmo

88
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:38,171
and its structure.
Using these knowledge,

89
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,142
we are now able to
utilize science

90
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,678
for various purposes
thanks to Aristle.

91
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,882
However, well-being Aristle
believed the most important

92
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:53,119
and biggest problem

93
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,623
has never been tackled
scientifically

94
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,626
at all.

95
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,928
So people is

96
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,632
still studying various
models and theory

97
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:09,869
about well being.

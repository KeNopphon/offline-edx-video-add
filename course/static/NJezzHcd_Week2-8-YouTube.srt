00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
How to act as engineer
on the site (3)

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
Without any major
development,

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
the launch day
came.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
A cold wave and
temperature drop were

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
forecast on the very day.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
Before examining
the situation

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
of the day before,

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
we will look at

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
a few more facts.

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
Why did NASA decide

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
to carry out
the launching?

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
In the beginning,
NASA estimated

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
the space shuttle project
would yield profits.

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
However,

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
limited number of times of

16
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
for launching caused a
delay in the project.

17
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
Another factor was

18
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
the emerging rivalries
in Europe,

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
who had similar space
shuttle projects.

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
Furthermore,

21
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
due to the delay
in progress,

22
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
the American Congress began

23
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
to question the
NASA's project,

24
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
as it didn't give
sufficient results

25
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
corresponding the
enormous investment.

26
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
To appeal the Congress,

27
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
in 1986, NASA had a
congested plan of launching,

28
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
such as a space probe for
examination of Halley's Comet.

29
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
The biggest reason
for NASA

30
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
to carry out the
launching of Challenger

31
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,011
is said to be
Reagan's intention.

32
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,014
To evade public criticism

33
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,017
against his
education policy,

34
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
Reagan wanted to include

35
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,023
a civilian
schoolteacher McAuliffe

36
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,026
as a Challenger
crew member,

37
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,029
making her the first teacher

38
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
who gave a class
for children

39
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
from the space.

40
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
In his draft of the State
of the Union address,

41
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,986
Reagan was celebrating
McAuliffe's achievement

42
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,989
and the arrival of new era.

43
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,992
The President's
political intention was

44
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,995
a major cause of the
launching of Challenger.

45
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,998
Could you explain about

46
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,001
the situation the day
before the launch?

47
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,004
Yes. It was a
drastic evening.

48
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,007
Forecasts for the time of

49
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,010
launching in the night

50
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
predicted an unusually
low-temperature,

51
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,016
- 1â„ƒ.

52
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,019
It was far beyond the
lowest temperature

53
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,022
at the preceding
launchings.

54
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,025
Knowing the forecast,

55
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,028
Mr. Boisjoly and his team

56
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,031
firmly believed that

57
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,034
this cold temperature would

58
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,037
reduce the durability
of O-rings,

59
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,973
threatening the
lives of crews.

60
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,976
They visited the vice
president engineer,

61
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,979
Land, and claimed
to postpone

62
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,982
the launching.

63
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,985
Convinced by the team,

64
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
Land decided to suggest

65
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,991
the postponement to NASA.

66
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000
To launch the Challenger,

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,003
approvals from not only
the Morton-Thiokol

68
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,006
but from all the involved
companies were needed.

69
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,009
In principle, therefore,

70
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,012
if the Morton-Thiokol would

71
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,015
have withdrawn
their approval,

72
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,018
the launching
were cancelled.

73
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,021
At the teleconference
on the evening,

74
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,024
Morton-Thiokol discussed
the weather conditions

75
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
and their concern
about the O-rings

76
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,030
with NASA managers

77
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,966
from Kennedy Space Center

78
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,969
and Marshall Space
Flight Center.

79
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,981
The data on the correlation

80
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,984
between the temperature
and rubber's resilience

81
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
provided by Mr. Boisjoly's team,

82
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,990
however,

83
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,993
showed only the cases

84
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,996
with flaws and
did not include

85
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,999
those without flaws,

86
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,002
failing in proving
the exact condition

87
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,005
under which a flaw
can be unavoidable.

88
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,020
When Morton-Thiokol Inc.
asked for some time

89
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,023
to review their data,

90
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,960
and five-minutes
of suspension

91
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,963
of the conference
was approved.

92
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,966
In the off-line
internal meeting

93
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,969
within Morton Thiokol,

94
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,972
which lasted over 30 mins,

95
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,975
Mr. Boisjoly and Thompson
re-expressed

96
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,978
their concern to
the managements.

97
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,987
They opposed the launch

98
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,990
and claimed its
postponement.

99
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,993
However, the managers
from NASA,

100
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,996
including a legend-engineer
George Hardy

101
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,999
and the space shuttle solid
rocket booster program manager,

102
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,002
Larry Mulloy,

103
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,005
clearly expressed
unpleasant feelings

104
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:48,008
against Morton-Thiokol.

105
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,017
The provided data was not

106
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,953
as strong and decisive

107
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,956
as to prove the urgent

108
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,959
need of postponement.

109
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,962
These factors affected

110
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,965
the decision-making process of

111
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,968
the management of
Morton-Thiokol.

112
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,971
Eventually,

113
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,974
as the discussion
was stuck,

114
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,977
the Morton-Thiokol's
Senior Vice President

115
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,980
of Operations, J. Mason,

116
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,983
started to shout
impatiently

117
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,986
at other three
managements

118
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,989
at the meeting, C. Wiggins,

119
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,992
J. Kilminster
and Lund; asking,

120
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,995
"Am I the only one

121
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,998
who wants to launch?"

122
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,001
Confronting Mason's anger

123
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,004
against the
postponement,

124
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,007
Wiggins and Kilminster
were convinced

125
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,010
that they needed to make
a management judgment

126
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,946
and agreed to launch
as scheduled.

127
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,949
Lund, who was opposing

128
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,952
to the bitter end,

129
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,955
withdrew his opposition

130
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,958
when Mason, the vice
president of operations,

131
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,961
shouted at him:

132
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,964
"It is time to take off
your engineering hat

133
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,967
and put on your
management hat."

134
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,970
Today this phrase

135
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,973
is infamous,
unfortunately.

136
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,976
Mason's word was decisive,

137
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,979
and Lund decided to vote

138
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,982
to approve the launch,

139
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,985
making the 4 affirmative vote

140
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,988
against 0 negative vote.

141
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,991
After this discussion,
Morton-Thiokol Inc.

142
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,994
obtained the consent
for the launch.

143
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,997
Morton-Thiokol submitted

144
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,000
the agreement
document to NASA,

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,003
which confirmed the
safety of rooster

146
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,939
for a launch and
signed by Wilkinson,

147
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,942
who was in charge of

148
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,945
the booster locket project.

149
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,948
Upon submission

150
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,951
of Morton-Thiokol's
agreement,

151
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,954
the permission was
finally given

152
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,957
for the launch of the Challenger

153
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,960
as it was originally
scheduled.

154
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,963
In this way,
Morton-Thiokol Inc.

155
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,966
ended up 
approving the launch.

156
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,969
What would you do,

157
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,972
if you were Mr. Boisjoly?

158
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,975
1) Respect the final
management judgment,

159
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,978
and simply wish the O-rings

160
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,981
seal tightly under the
low air temperature.

161
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,984
2) Report the
management of NASA

162
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,987
that the safety
is under threat;

163
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,993
3) Make notice to the
family of crew members

164
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,996
about the potential
risk of safety;

165
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,999
4) Make public announcement
via mass media

166
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,002
to claim for
postponement of a launch

167
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,005
under cold-temperature;

168
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,008
5) Take some other actions.

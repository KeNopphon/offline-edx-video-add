00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,009
Space Shuttle Challenger
disaster (2) --- as a lesson of
engineer's ethics

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
The disaster of space
shuttle Challenger occurred

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
on January 28, 1986,
in front of

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
the eyes of people all
over the world.

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
The space shuttle
Challenger broke apart and

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
exploded 73 seconds
after it was launched

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
from the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
Among the seven crew members

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
there was a civilian
teacher,

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
Christa McAuliffe,

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
who would have been

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
the first teacher in space.

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
All the seven crew members
died in the shuttle.

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
It was a disaster.

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
Actually, on the
very day of the launch,

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
the area of Florida was hit

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
by a record-breaking
cold wave.

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
The temperature at
the time of the launch

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
was 2.2â„ƒ below freezing, which
was far below

20
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
the usual temperature in
this season in Florida.

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
The Challenger was launched

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
under these unusual conditions;

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
the air temperature was
lower than average

24
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
in previous launches by
good 10 degrees.

25
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
This unusual cold
temperature was

26
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
the reason that
caused the accident.

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
Look at the picture of
the Challenger.

28
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
The orbiter with delta wing

29
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
is equipped with

30
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
the main engine.

31
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
Atop the orbiter is

32
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
the external fuel tank

33
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
marked in red

34
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
to supply the main engine

35
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
with liquid fuel.

36
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
The external fuel
tank is equipped

37
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
with a solid-rocket booster

38
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
on each side,

39
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
which generate

40
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
the primary propulsion.

41
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,002
All the parts

42
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
excluding the
external fuel tank

43
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
will be collected

44
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,011
and reused.

45
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,014
The next slide illustrates

46
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,017
the solid-rocket booster.

47
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
Each part was produced

48
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,023
in a plant of the
Morton-Thiokol in Utah,

49
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,026
a corporation under contract

50
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,029
with the NASA, and

51
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
then assembled together at

52
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida.

53
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,038
The field joint,

54
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,041
which joint several
parts together

55
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,044
has to airtight

56
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,980
to seal the hot,

57
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
high-pressure gasses.

58
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,992
The investigation of the
special commission

59
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,995
appointed by U.S.
President Ronald Regan,

60
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,998
concluded that

61
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,001
the accident was caused

62
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,004
by the hot gasses leaked

63
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,007
from the joint,

64
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,010
which ignited the
external fuel tank

65
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
and set off the explosion.

66
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,016
The field joints were sealed

67
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,019
with rubber O-rings.

68
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,022
However, the unusually
cold temperature

69
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,025
reduced elasticity
of the rubber,

70
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,028
and the O-rings failed

71
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,031
to fulfill the expected
sealing function.

72
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,037
To enhance the performance,

73
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,973
the joints were sealed
with two O-rings,

74
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,976
but the burning gas

75
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,979
melted them both

76
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,982
and reached the outside.

77
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
Actually, Morton-Thiokol
had recognized

78
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,991
the flaw in field joints
already in 1970's

79
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,994
at the developmental stage

80
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,997
of the shuttle.

81
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000
In this lecture,

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,003
we will examine

83
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,006
the case of Challenger

84
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,009
from the perspective of

85
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,012
on-site engineer, Boisjoly.

86
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,015
Certainly, to give a
comprehensive analysis of

87
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,018
the case from science
historical

88
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,021
and technological
viewpoints,

89
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,024
closer examinations
on evidences

90
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
from both NASA

91
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,030
and Morton-Thiokol
are necessary.

92
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,969
In this lecture, however,

93
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,972
we will examine the case

94
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,975
from an educational point of view

95
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,978
for engineering ethics,

96
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,981
focusing especially on

97
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,984
Boisjoly's engagement

98
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
rather than

99
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,990
historical studies
of the case.

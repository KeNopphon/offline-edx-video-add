1
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:15,151
In this course, you have studied

2
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:17,806
seven step guides as a way to ethical decision making.

3
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:21,668
Along with the way, I hope you consider

4
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:23,931
how you make decision 

5
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:27,404
in some situations.

6
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:31,636
In this course website, you can reach to 

7
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:35,416
some links, and you can see many matters 

8
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:38,904
in newspaper,

9
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:45,280
I hope you to suppose if you are in the situation,

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,320
what you do with the seven step guides.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,433
And I hope you to improve your ability

12
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:55,902
to make decision ethically.

13
00:00:55,902 --> 00:01:00,231
We have seen, in this lecture, explosion of space shuttle challenger, 

14
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:02,779
which turned out to be the worst case,

15
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:05,802
and,

16
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:10,315
In this lecture, we are going to see 

17
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:12,834
how good decision makings by engineers

18
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:16,377
affected to some case, 

19
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:19,717
using some examples.

20
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:25,119
In the second half of this lecture,

21
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,778
we are going to think about 

22
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:35,436
the new idea of engineer ethics. Mr. Kono,

23
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:40,635
do you know from 1960s to 1970s,

24
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:45,795
what happened in the river, the sea, and the sky 

25
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:49,546
in Japan.

26
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:52,103
What happened, I have no idea because I have not been borned yet at that time.

27
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:54,983
So I don't have any memories about that, but I heard

28
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:56,199
there was heavy air pollusion,

29
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,155
and were environmental problems,

30
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:00,328
It was really serious, right.

31
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,877
Yes, exactly.

32
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:04,779
I was also still small child,

33
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:08,152
like when I was a student,

34
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:12,844
the river was really dirty due to 

35
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:15,508
industrial waste water.

36
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:18,572
smelt stinky, too.

37
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:23,073
Around factories, the area was polluted by sludge.

38
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:25,622
I think you have heard about that,

39
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:27,795
we never tried to swim 

40
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:30,476
in such a situation

41
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:33,869
Moreover, air and atomosphere

42
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:37,839
were deadly dirty

43
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:42,591
because of smog.

44
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:45,473
It was really bad air pollution, environmental problem

45
00:02:45,473 --> 00:02:49,251
like unbelievable level of pollution.

46
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:52,562
1960s to 1970s was the days like that.

47
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:55,756
We will see a case which happened 

48
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:57,958
in those days.

49
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,700
Before moving on,

50
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,034
I want you to remind that I talk about 

51
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:08,578
the case for educational purpose rather than 

52
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:12,432
historical fact.

53
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:15,805
I just intend to introduce it 

54
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:20,157
to suport the content of my lecture.

55
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:23,251
Do you know Honda,

56
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:25,926
car industrial company, don't you.

57
00:03:25,926 --> 00:03:27,911
Of course. (lauging)

58
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:31,384
What image do you have 

59
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:34,802
to Honda, like the company leading 

60
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:38,328
Japanese car industry,

61
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:40,540
right.

62
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,982
But, Honda was a small company 

63
00:03:43,982 --> 00:03:50,449
compared with other previous companies

64
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:52,670
such as Nissan and Toyota.

65
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,643
The reason Honda developed from Japanese small company

66
00:03:56,643 --> 00:04:00,598
to the worldwide company because of  

67
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,066
development of engine, 

68
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:08,375
we will see that here.

69
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,354
Let's see the first slide.

70
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:15,230
Honda motors, we call it Honda here,

71
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:21,503
This is the company founded 

72
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:25,587
by Soichiro Honda,

73
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:28,370
we call him Mr. Honda or Soichiro here,

74
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:34,225
in 1984.

75
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:37,841
He sticked to be in front line,

76
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:41,707
he leaded technical teams.

77
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:45,960
Takeo Fujisawa, Mr. Honda's partner, 

78
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,504
worked for management.

79
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:56,535
When the company was founded, it was really small 

80
00:04:56,535 --> 00:05:00,126
and they made motorbicycles.

81
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:07,204
and then the company would develop 

82
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:09,642
to the top company in Japan, as you know.

83
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,735
I will introduce here low pollution engine,

84
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:17,724
called CVCC,

85
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:23,001
Honda is working on.

86
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:30,276
Today, worldwide companies work on CSR,

87
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:35,022
which is their social responsibilities, 

88
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:39,162
admitting  environment value is social manner.

89
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:43,855
When Honda was developing as a

90
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:47,901
a maker of motorbicycles,

91
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:50,726
from 1950s to 1960s,

92
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:55,408
it was after world war 2,

93
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:58,916
when Japan was recovering,

94
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:02,674
people sticked to economical development,

95
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:07,103
they ignore pollution

96
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,642
to gain economical profit.

97
00:06:09,642 --> 00:06:13,671
No one doubt.Honda did not 

98
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:16,439
work on anything special for environment

99
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,738
in those days.

100
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:25,493
In those days, Honda thought

101
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:28,960
speed was  the most valuable for motorbicycles and cars.

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,542
Or their power.

103
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,439
So they made vehicles for racings,

104
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,267
and sticked to good results in the racings.

105
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:43,623
They won 1st in the world of motorbicycles, 

106
00:06:43,623 --> 00:06:49,031
even more, they also tried to win in the world of cars.

107
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:52,831
In the late 1960s, Shizuo Yagi, 

108
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:56,143
he was an engineer of 

109
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:57,441
developing engines,

110
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:01,186
wondered

111
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:06,440
if it is good  for them to think about only 

112
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,739
speed.

113
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:13,198
What they should tackle on 

114
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:14,674
other than speed.

115
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:17,812
Then,

116
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:22,080
he read an artcle about air pollution caused by 

117
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,033
gas by chance.

118
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:29,930
And he thought

119
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,720
This was it, this was the thing 

120
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,658
they should tackle on next.

121
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:43,408
He started studying about it.

122
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:47,706
In those days, the problem of exaust emission of cars

123
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:51,012
were, to what extent, recognized in Japan.

124
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,088
It was just beginning

125
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:57,212
to work on the pollution.

126
00:07:57,212 --> 00:08:01,464
When Mr. Yagi started working for the problem, 

127
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:06,359
there were no devices to measure 

128
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,615
toxic substance in the air.

129
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:10,640
I see (laughing)

130
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,869
I' am serious, so 

131
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:17,959
Mr. Yagi had to invent the device 

132
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:21,303
from the scratch by hiself.

133
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:25,363
Then he made the device, and 

134
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:30,471
investigated exausted gas of their cars.

135
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:36,263
They were so surprised.

136
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:39,787
Because it turned out much toxic gas

137
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:45,548
was in their exausted gas.

138
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:52,118
The device they made notify Mr.Yagi that,

139
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:54,298
their car,

140
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:57,742
the cars they made produced 

141
00:08:57,742 --> 00:09:03,099
much toxic gas, 

142
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:07,450
He was so shocked.

143
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,894
To solve air pollution

144
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:16,262
was really important task for engineers,

145
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:21,479
He realized that.

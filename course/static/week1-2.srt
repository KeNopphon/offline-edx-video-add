00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,504
When you talk about learning

2
00:00:13,504 --> 00:00:14,904
science and engineering ethics

3
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:16,293
do you only mean

4
00:00:16,293 --> 00:00:17,992
learning certain rules such as

5
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:20,478
you must not do this

6
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,070
or you must do that?

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,818
Is this what learning ethics all about?

8
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,611
I think that there are many people who

9
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:28,907
have this kind of idea about ethics.

10
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:32,888
But there is definitely more than that.

11
00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:36,978
First of all, what is ethics, what constitutes ethical judgement?

12
00:00:36,978 --> 00:00:39,565
This is what I'd also like you

13
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:41,665
to think about.

14
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:44,157
Please take a look at this slide.

15
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:47,143
When I talk about the ethics of science

16
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:50,725
or ethics of technology

17
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:54,908
I imagine the image of a balance like this.

18
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:58,997
As Mr. Kono said earlier, many people think that

19
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:00,494
ethics is about norms and rules

20
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:04,681
that must be adhered to and preserved.

21
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,462
I'm aware that this is

22
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:09,957
a very common preconception.

23
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:12,547
However, in this course,

24
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:15,734
I would like you to step out of these restrictive notions.

25
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:22,113
Instead, think about ethics as

26
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:24,105
a sort of balance, or a balance of values.

27
00:01:24,105 --> 00:01:25,696
This is what I will be talking about.

28
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:29,677
When we analyse how to make ethical judgement

29
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:32,670
we can see that it is actually about

30
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,153
finding a balance between various issues.

31
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:36,543
This is how I see it.

32
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:40,231
For example, consider about engineers and technicians

33
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:44,955
in the course of their daily work they

34
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:47,147
need to take into account in many different values.

35
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:49,236
The most important one is, of course...

36
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:51,424
Safety, but that is not all.

37
00:01:51,424 --> 00:01:55,211
This is not determined by only safety alone.

38
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:58,400
There are other concerns, such as cost

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,879
or deadlines, or whether to try a new design.

40
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,474
Or a product's durability.

41
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:08,464
There are many factors we can assign value to.

42
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:11,554
We seek a balance between these values

43
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:14,337
when making decisions.

44
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:16,533
Making an ethical decision

45
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,122
means making the right call.

46
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:21,217
Making an unethical decision

47
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:22,615
means making an inappropriate choice.

48
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:26,892
Finding the correct balance between values

49
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:30,382
is a creative process.

50
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:34,656
It requires an imaginative approach.

51
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:37,643
Making ethical considerations

52
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:40,639
means seeking the right balance

53
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,016
in the decision-making process.

54
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:47,208
Now, I have been talking about values.

55
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,103
The actual concept of values

56
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,687
will be the key throughout the course

57
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:56,978
so please keep that in mind.

58
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:00,961
Now that this is clear

59
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:04,452
I would like to start the lecture.

60
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:07,637
Yes, please go ahead.

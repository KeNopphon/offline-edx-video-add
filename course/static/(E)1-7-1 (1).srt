1
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:14,454
So, if we think of humanity on the scale of the Cosmic Calendar,

2
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:19,045
we have created science and technology

3
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:23,130
merely a second ago.

4
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,328
One second in the Cosmic Calendar

5
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:29,310
is about 475 years, as I said before.

6
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,996
Now think of the last 0.25 seconds.

7
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:38,086
A quarter of a second, the modern times.

8
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:42,073
Think of what mankind has achieved

9
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:45,161
in the 20th century.

10
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:47,952
Here on this slide we have

11
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:52,545
a list of the greatest technological achievements

12
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:56,932
from the 20th century,

13
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:05,482
compiled by the United States National Academy of Engineering. So this is the list.

14
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,264
We, humans, have been alive for only one second in the Cosmic Calendar,

15
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:10,261
managed to create these technologies

16
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,452
within a quarter of a second.

17
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:16,442
At the same time,

18
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:20,027
we have potentially gained the knowledge and ability

19
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:24,130
that would enable us to destroy Earth.

20
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,214
Do you see what I mean?

21
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:28,707
There are always two sides to a coin.

22
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:32,689
Precisely. Now please take a look

23
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,585
at the next slide.

24
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:37,781
This is a picture of cities on the Earth

25
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:42,162
taken by NASA.

26
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:44,958
Although it is a beautiful sight

27
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:51,245
energy is necessary to produce all this light.

28
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,238
How long will this light continue to glimmer

29
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:57,259
on Earth with its finite resources?

30
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:02,046
In other words, how long can our technological civilisation

31
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:05,929
continue to thrive and progress?

32
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:09,723
This is something to think about.

33
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:13,117
On to the next slide...

34
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:20,894
This graph shows the changes in our population

35
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:24,880
and energy demand from the year 1800.

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:32,551
At the end of the 19th century there were 1.7 billion people.

37
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,148
As for the energy demand

38
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:39,741
it would be equivalent to

39
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:41,634
 500 million tons of oil per year.

40
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:43,733
However, only 100 years since then,

41
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:44,692
only 0.25 seconds

42
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:48,885
 on the Cosmic Calendar scale,

43
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:52,978
in the year 2000, our population was about 6 billion.

44
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:57,164
And now it is over 7 billion.

45
00:02:57,164 --> 00:03:01,557
Our energy consumption in the year 2000

46
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,140
was about 9.2 billion tons of oil a year.

47
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,042
Within just a century,

48
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:11,331
less than a quarter second in the Cosmic Calendar,

49
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:15,915
our population quadrupled, and energy consumption increased 18 times.

50
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:19,416
That is quite rapid.

51
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,605
The per capita energy consumption

52
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:25,644
rose about 5 times.

53
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:28,335
The energy consumption

54
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:32,526
is not evenly distributed across the world.

55
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:37,603
It has not risen that much for people

56
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:38,806
in the developing countries that account for

57
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:42,294
the majority of the world's population.

58
00:03:42,294 --> 00:03:43,493
This huge rise in energy consumption

59
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:47,285
is caused by the people of developed countries

60
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:53,766
such as Japan, the USA

61
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,960
 and European countries.

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,856
In the light of this,

63
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:03,237
it is easy to see why the Earth quickly became

64
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:06,446
so polluted in the 20th century.

65
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:11,616
If developing countries continue to industrialize

66
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:15,210
and increase their energy consumption

67
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,299
just like the already developed countries had done,

68
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,798
we can easily imagine how disastrous

69
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,588
that might be.

70
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:27,079
Well, the Cosmic Calendar

71
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,175
illustrates the greatness of mankind

72
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:35,460
but it also puts our existence into perspective

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,562
by showing just how brief

74
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:39,449
our history on this planet is.

75
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,646
It gives us a frame of reference.

76
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:48,027
Think from this perspective about

77
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:51,819
the engineers and scientists who have to tackle ethical problems

78
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:56,910
and about the regulations they need to abide by.

79
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,607
These established rules

80
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:02,903
may seem set in stone

81
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,689
and impossible to change.

82
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:07,687
People think this is just how it is.

83
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,490
It is quite common

84
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,782
to think this way.

85
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:16,566
But looking at it from the broad perspective

86
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,570
there is nothing that definitely cannot be changed.

87
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,547
These issues are merely

88
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:28,440
a brief local phenomenon.

89
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,642
The bigger perspective lets us see that

90
00:05:31,642 --> 00:05:35,030
anything can be changed if you set your mind to it.

91
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,450
It gives us courage

92
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,521
to act.

93
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:45,308
Well, then, what about the future?

94
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:50,200
Our future?

95
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,895
We're in the 21st century now.

96
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,552
In Cosmic Calendar terms the 21st century

97
00:05:56,552 --> 00:06:00,133
is less than a quarter of a second.

98
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:04,330
Within this time, how should

99
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,921
the relationship between science and society develop?

100
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:08,419
Or how, in what way

101
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,403
should we keep science and technology

102
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:16,698
under control?

103
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:20,192
I often use this picture

104
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:24,582
of a race car.

105
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:29,875
It is precisely because it's a time when humanity depends on technology

106
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:34,062
that engineers and scientists are expected to

107
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:37,957
make ethical decisions based on the macro point of view,

108
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:40,245
on a broad perspective.

109
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:43,141
And why is that the case?

110
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:46,838
Technology was born

111
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:52,026
only a second ago in the Cosmic Calendar.

112
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:54,916
Let me give you a metaphor.

113
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,415
At that time we, humans,

114
00:06:57,415 --> 00:07:00,302
were like a driver

115
00:07:00,302 --> 00:07:01,906
that just got a driverâ€™s license.

116
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:05,885
Having just stepped outside,

117
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,784
the brand new license in hand,

118
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:11,773
the freshly-minted driver comes across a race car.

119
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:15,861
This car is a metaphor for technology.

120
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:20,855
Normally, rookie drivers

121
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:23,856
do not get to drive race cars just like that.

122
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:24,757
It is quite scary to imagine what might happen if they did.

123
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:27,460
But our driver finds this race car with its engine on,

124
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,148
everything in gear, ready to go.

125
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:33,841
The tank is full of petrol.

126
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:37,423
The road ahead is unusually wide.

127
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,715
The driver tentatively steps on the accelerator.

128
00:07:39,715 --> 00:07:41,814
The racing car, the technology,

129
00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:44,904
starts and gains momentum.

130
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:48,794
Mankind sees technology as an amazing thing

131
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:51,793
and lets it pick up more and more speed.

132
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:55,980
Our racing car

133
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,562
keeps going faster and faster.

134
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:04,764
We entered the second half of the 20th century

135
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:08,054
going at high speed.

136
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,110
We can not see what the future might hold.

137
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,710
Checking the fuel tank,

138
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,802
looking at the fuel gauge,

139
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:17,689
we notice we're running out of gas.

140
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:18,797
We cannot see what's ahead.

141
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:22,483
Maybe the road

142
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:24,485
isn't straight.

143
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:26,069
Maybe we're approaching a corner.

144
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:28,573
Maybe it's a hairpin corner.

145
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:31,360
And maybe what lies ahead is a wall.

146
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,747
This is the situation we're in.

147
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:39,238
We have never before

148
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:42,528
tried to step on the brake

149
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:46,225
of the racing car that is technology.

150
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,013
Neither have we used the steering wheel.

151
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:51,803
We're just greenhorns

152
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:56,597
who have only been pushing down on the accelerator.

153
00:08:56,597 --> 00:09:00,984
This is how we can describe our current situation.

154
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:04,169
This is the picture we get

155
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:08,768
when we look from the macro perspective,

156
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:09,955
from the perspective of time.

157
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:12,054
So how should the present-day

158
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:14,643
scientists and engineers act,

159
00:09:14,643 --> 00:09:16,243
what guidelines should they use

160
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:18,346
to make decisions?

161
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:22,030
Sometimes thinking from such a big perspective,

162
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,424
from the macro perspective,

163
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:26,522
will let you see things more clearly,

164
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:28,011
and give you new ideas.

165
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:29,655
I see, that makes sense!

1
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:15,922
Moreover,  about happiness, Japanese constitution

2
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:19,229
states in its 13rd sentence.

3
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:24,518
Mr. Kono, have you ever had 

4
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:28,635
opportunities to think about happiness or well-being

5
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:32,236
in academic place 

6
00:00:32,236 --> 00:00:35,017
like high school 

7
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:37,786
or university.

8
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:41,562
No, I have never had opportunities to think about it 

9
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:43,620
explicitly

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,632
I think.

11
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:47,445
You have been educated,

12
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:51,710
And I also attended schools,

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:58,178
but I also have never had chance

14
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:01,899
to think about well-being

15
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,113
in junior high school, 

16
00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:09,215
high school, and university

17
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:15,684
at all. But 

18
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:17,958
as we have seen,

19
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:21,409
a mission of tokyo institution of industory 

20
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,896
code of conduct in conference

21
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:26,278
states well-being

22
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:30,016
clearly in them.

23
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:34,358
And Aristole also identifies it is important,

24
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:37,607
and japanese constitution

25
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:40,701
clearly mention it,

26
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,608
we have never thought about 

27
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:46,290
well-being.

28
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,859
As you say,

29
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,395
We can see the word "happiness" itself

30
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:53,866
in many places today.

31
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:57,329
Actually, the word "well-being" is 

32
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,708
noticed around the world.

33
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:10,245
For example, the Pope published 

34
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:12,831
the 10 clues to be happier,

35
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:15,714
many magazines are interested in 

36
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:18,145
well-being.

37
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:23,017
But when I start thinking about well-being,

38
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,464
I realize

39
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:28,042
it is a little bit complicated.

40
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:30,862
Especially, when we pick up Japan as an example,

41
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:34,611
it seems strange for me.

42
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:38,114
How about you, Mr. Kono. What do you think about Japan.

43
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:41,003
for security, its power,

44
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:44,786
hospitality.. 

45
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:46,935
What do you think.

46
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:48,433
I personally think

47
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:50,745、
Japan is comfortable country to live,

48
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:52,661
Personally.

49
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:58,767
Our GDP is the third highest followed America and China.

50
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:01,008
Japan is very economically powerful,

51
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:05,767
and safe, and clean.

52
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:11,988
I have visited many countries and cities

53
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:15,713
for the purpose of my business

54
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:20,536
Japan is really good to live.

55
00:03:20,536 --> 00:03:25,410
But Leicester University in Great Britain

56
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,805
in 2006, made world happiness map,

57
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:31,453
according to the map,

58
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:35,273
Japan ranked at 90th in the world.

59
00:03:35,273 --> 00:03:36,794
90th... (laughing)

60
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:41,059
Yes, 90th. what do you think.

61
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,285
Don't you think it is strange.

62
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:44,513
(laughing)

63
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:49,509
OECD, which many countries belong 

64
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:52,748
to economic development ,

65
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:54,998
international organization

66
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:58,602
sees countries through GDP, which is macro

67
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:02,638
index, but

68
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:06,764
currently, they use

69
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:09,896
well-being indicators.

70
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:14,168
Strangely, OECD does not 

71
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:17,379
make rankings about it unlike the Lecester University.

72
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:20,628
But they shows various items, like 

73
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:25,061
income, housing, and employment.

74
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:28,454
they research the average,

75
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:31,359
and how is each country 

76
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,183
in OECD.

77
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:35,940
This is what they do.

78
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,140
They also have some more interesteing,

79
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,225
This is very interesting,

80
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:43,816
but what I want you to see is 

81
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,634
satisfaction of life.

82
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:49,548
Most countries in OECD are 

83
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:55,147
developed countries, so 59% of people

84
00:04:55,147 --> 00:04:58,102
are satisfied with their life.

85
00:04:58,102 --> 00:05:05,482
Though Japanese is satisfied just only 40%.

86
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:08,948
This is weird.

87
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:12,742
Moreover,

88
00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:17,341
Many people taking this course,

89
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:21,300
their parents

90
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,823
or

91
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,755
their grand parents,

92
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:27,501
they have worked for the country hard

93
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:31,404
thanks to those effort,

94
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:37,126
and thanks to researchers in Tokyo Institutions of Industory,

95
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:39,041
Thanks to everything I mentioned, 

96
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,967
Japan has been becoming rich.

97
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,274
blue line in this figure,

98
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:49,922
is about Japanese GDP.

99
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:54,938
it always increases, that is, Japan becomes rich.

100
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,356
it shows.

101
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:01,158
However, satisfaction of life

102
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:03,636
orange line shows it,

103
00:06:03,636 --> 00:06:07,156
it decreases.

104
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:10,465
Strange.

105
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:13,005
Aeconomist Easterlin

106
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,943
found out and he named it 

107
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,934
Paradox of Easterlin.

108
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:19,655
It means

109
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,958
richer people become, 

110
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:26,102
poorer their satisfaction of life is.

111
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:28,519
This is paradox.

112
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,088
Yes.

113
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:34,630
In addition, the rate of suiceide in Japan is

114
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,760
high compared to other developed countries.

115
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,911
Japan is safe and clean, though,

116
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:47,793
poor satisfaction of life and 

117
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:53,508
many people kill themselves.

118
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:57,094
it is strange.

119
00:06:57,094 --> 00:07:02,555
And another data says,

120
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:07,008
the data is from Japanese government,

121
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:10,924
richness of stuff or richness of heart,

122
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:14,827
which is more important

123
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:18,100
the government asks Japanese people every year

124
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,614
Unitil 1980, richness of stuff isb more important 

125
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:25,764
for them than richness of heart.

126
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:27,642
People think.

127
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:29,736
However, after 1980,

128
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:32,739
people think richness of heart is 

129
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:35,536
more important.

130
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:38,927
How about you, Mr. Kono.

131
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:41,303
Which do you think 

132
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:43,482
it is more important for you.

133
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:48,771
I think, as you think,

134
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,773
richness of heart is more important 

135
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:53,160
even though we become economically powerful.

136
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,340
(laughing)

137
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,259
I see.

138
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,187
Then, hou about 

139
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,998
money or hapiness.

140
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:03,403
To become happier,

141
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:07,691
Do you think money is importan.t

142
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:10,041
If you do not have money, 

143
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,266
you cannot get stuff and become unhappy,

144
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:13,440
so, I think Money is important.

145
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,557
(laughing)

146
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:15,050
when I am asked to choose one, 

147
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,472
I cannot choose actually.

148
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:23,453
Many people think they need money

149
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:26,815
to be happy,

150
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:31,173
but many research shows

151
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:36,432
money, hapiness, and satisfaction  

152
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:40,701
do not relate to each other much.

153
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,612
This is a result of statics

154
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:45,267
conducted in America ,

155
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:50,424、
yearly income 35,000 dollers, if we say 1 doller is worth 100 yen,

156
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:57,508
people who get less than 3,500,000 yen have 

157
00:08:57,508 --> 00:09:00,033
lower happiness in America.

158
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:03,414
However, income is 35,000 doller to 50,000 doller,

159
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:06,037
in short, even if your income improve 35,000 to 50,000 dollers,

160
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:08,974
5,000,000yen to 10,000,000yen,

161
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:11,049
or over 10,000,000 yen,

162
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:15,171、
hapiness is not improved much.

163
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:19,482
at least this data says.

164
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:22,330
Other studies shows 

165
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,355
however, other result,

166
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,345
they conclude

167
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:31,293
we can see the relationship between money and hapiness

168
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:33,634
a little bit,

169
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:38,326
So actually, the studies are still going.

170
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:42,230、
Let's see 

171
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,313
how American people

172
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:46,923
answered 

173
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:49,150
when they are asked,

174
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,836
this is multiple choice questions though, 

175
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:53,692
First,

176
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:56,234
this is the item most people chose,

177
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:58,970
relationship with their children

178
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,289
Their children make thhem happier, 

179
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:09,354
77% of people chose it.

180
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:12,415
And friendship makes them happier,

181
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:16,509
when they contribute to someone,

182
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:23,484
75% of people chose them.

183
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:25,262
4th is about husband or wife.

184
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:27,240
Or relationship with their lover.

185
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,658
This makes people happier, 74 % of people chose it.

186
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:35,233
So first 4 items are important when we consider 

187
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,639
hapiness

188
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,541
first 4 items are what I introduced now.

189
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,754
The answer is the relationships among people

190
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:44,085
not money or stuff.

191
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:45,632
This is the answer.

192
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:48,288
How were these studies about 

193
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:51,020
hapiness or well-being

194
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,013
started.

195
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:58,354
Of course, studies about hapiness  

196
00:10:58,354 --> 00:11:00,209
is made long time ago,

197
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:04,555
era of Aristole, or further before

198
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:08,618
in many countries or cultures. 

199
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:16,217
Martin Segman is the first person who started it 

200
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:23,160
scientifically. He is an psychologist in America.

201
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,481
He is a professor in the  University of Pensylvania

202
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:30,568
He is an experimental psychologist.

203
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:36,996
He is a chairman in American Psychology Association.

204
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:42,169
He was elected by three times vote from

205
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,062
the second applicant,

206
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:48,922
then he was elected as a chairman. 

207
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:50,904
American Psychological Asscociation

208
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:53,175
is the biggest asscociation

209
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:56,517
both in America and in the world.

210
00:11:56,517 --> 00:12:00,679
Professor Segliman 

211
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,672
will have to 

212
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:07,024
decide which way psychology to go 

213
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:11,108
in the future.

214
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:13,939
He had to state that.

215
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:17,001
what do you think Professor Segliman said.

216
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:20,441
He said various things though,

217
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,126
in his keynote,

218
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:24,287
what he said 

219
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,622
is 

220
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:30,067
APsychology in America contributed to 

221
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:34,737
patients who awere told never be cured

222
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:37,391
were told never be cured,

223
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:41,427
and made manuals to diagnose 

224
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,758
people who have mental problems,

225
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:48,731
That is great,

226
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:51,327
he said.

227
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:55,461
And Professor Segliman continues

228
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:59,747
people who have mental issue are at most 

229
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:03,650
20-30 percent,

230
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,016
the rest of 70% live healthier

231
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:11,741
like Mr. Kono,

232
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:14,554
Psychology ishould be for hose 70% 

233
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:17,591
can live better,

234
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:21,141
we should use 

235
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:24,651
intervention,

236
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:28,469
this is a technical term, 

237
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:32,271
we should use intervention for 

238
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:35,568
helthy people to live better.

239
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:37,943
He proposed. Professor Segliman 

240
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:41,217
stated he named it positive psychology

241
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:44,319
to people, then

242
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,561
The history of positive psychology 

243
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:50,150
has officially 

244
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,645
started.

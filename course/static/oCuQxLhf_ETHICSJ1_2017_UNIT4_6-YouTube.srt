1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,990
Associations or parties related to



2
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,190
engineer ethics around the world

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,410
have their ethic manuals, as we have seen,

4
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,090
the manuals says what they have to focuse on in them.

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,579
clearly.

6
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,739
In the first part of the manuals,

7
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:39,950
they refer to principle like this slide

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,070
here is a manual made by

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,130
National Society of Professional Engineers

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,500
NSPE in America,

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,410
other associations also have similar 

12
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,260
principle as the associations in America.

13
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,120
Pronciple is about 

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,479
engineers have to focus on 

15
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,079
public safety, health, and welfare

16
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,750
when they work as engineers. it is expressed as hold paramount

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,179
as you know,



18
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:17,609
in English.


19
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:21,429
As I told,

20
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:24,759
Safety and health have been discussed 

21
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,450
much, I think thats's enough.

22
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,719
some people majors in Safety engineering.

23
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,889
but, as as written in the constitution, 

24
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,729
As  safety and health,

25
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:42,060
it is imoortant to put on focus

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,030
on welfare, or well-being 

27
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,469
in English.

28
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:53,920
engineers have never thought about 

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,310
welfare or well-being much,

30
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,469
and we expertise of engineer ethics also have 

31
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,150
never thought about it much.

32
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,670
I realized.

33
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,229
Welfare is mentioned

34
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,150
in the other parts, too.

35
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,840
I agree, this is a manual in 

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,120
Japan academic conference, which is 

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,590
an organization for researchers, 

38
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,760
it says about their code of conductions in it.

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,840
it is about responsibility for researchers.

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,099
This is the first line. The responsibility of researchers is 

41
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:39,760
to guarantee qualities of knowledge and techniques they produce, 

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,790
Also, to contribute to health and welfare

43
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,189
for human beings




44
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:50,400
through their experience, knowledge, and techniques.

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,569
This is clearly stated 



46
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:58,010
in it. By the way Mr. Kono,

47
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,200
Tokyo institute of industry, which we belong

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,939
has a mission.


49
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,069
Do you know what it is.

50
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,321
Excuse me, a mission...

51
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:07,370
Yes, a mission.

52
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,820
I have no idea at all.I'm so shame.

53
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,159
it is

54
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,659
writen in rule book of our organization,

55
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:21,840
it clearly states 

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,680
our purpose and mission.

57
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,859
We can see some sentences in it though,

58
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:32,689
in the first part and last part of it, 

59
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:36,189
to contribute to welfare is our purpose and 

60
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:40,680
mission. This is the reason our institute exists.

61
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,249
We can see the words "welfare" everywhere

62
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:48,150
or "well-being", 

63
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,920
many people say they are important, 

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,730
as our examples shows,

65
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,909
they say welfare is important,

66
00:03:57,909 --> 00:03:59,969
however, we have never discussed

67
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:04,970
well-being at all.

68
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,290
Mr. Kono is still new to our institution though,

69
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,409
in our institution,

70
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:13,730
have you ever had opportunities  

71
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,530
to talk about welfare.

72
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,970
No, never.


73
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,650
I see.

74
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,260
How well-being relates to 

75
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,310
ethics.

76
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,980
Good question.

77
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
Thanks.




78
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,550
Ethics is intended to think about 

79
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,630
well-being originally.

80
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,410
As I told,

81
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,280
well-being is translated into welfarein Japanese,

82
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,450
but sometimes,

83
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,670
it is translated into happiness.

84
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,260
anyway, it implies lots of meanings,

85
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,570
and it is interepret as many ways.



86
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,880
Now, I define well-being means 

87
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,700
living better




88
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,160
to avoid confusion.

1
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:14,664
This course is on

2
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:17,951
Science and Engineering Ethics.

3
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,337
Mr.Kono, first, I would like you to

4
00:00:21,337 --> 00:00:23,732
think about this example.

5
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,315
Mr. Kono, in country A,

6
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:32,826
assume you are working as an engineer

7
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,912
at a company and have been appointed to oversee the structural design

8
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:39,997
of a new high-rise building in the heart of the capital city.

9
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:46,976
The current Building Standards Act of Country A

10
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:50,957
only requires you to consider

11
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:54,844
wind hitting (load) the front of the building.

12
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:58,036
Your team assured you that the structural design

13
00:00:58,036 --> 00:01:03,010
would satisfy the building standards.

14
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,602
At the same time, the client was also satisfied.

15
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:09,692
Now, you returned back to your country,

16
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:12,181
when the construction was just about to begin,

17
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:15,668
an extremely rare, once-in a thousand years gigantic typhoon is approaching

18
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:18,251
which is a very rare occurrence in Country A.

19
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:23,934
But this occurrence was being taken into account.

20
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:28,314
Specifically, you already calculated the maximum wind speed of a typhoon in that category

21
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:32,405
that would hit the building.

22
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:37,083
Therefore, you knew that there wouldn't be any problem

23
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,173
if it hit the front of the building.

24
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:43,157
However, you realized that,

25
00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:45,251
if the wind hit the building from another angle,

26
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:48,341
it is likely that the building would collapse.

27
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:51,827
So, you inform your boss, and explain that

28
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:56,604
the structural design plans need to be amended.

29
00:01:56,604 --> 00:02:02,781
However, your boss responds in the following way:

30
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:05,173
The current design fulfils

31
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:07,356
the standards required by the laws of Country A.

32
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:10,146
It's also not necessary to change the design

33
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:13,734
for something that has a low probability of happening,

34
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,421
such as a once in a thousand years incident.

35
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:20,712
He really won't listen to your proposal.

36
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:23,093
If you were in this situation, Mr. Kono, what would you do?

37
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:25,283
Well, that's quite difficult...

38
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:26,980
Indeed, it is.

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,877
In such a situation,

40
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,762
you probably wouldn't know what to do or think.

41
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:34,450
As everybody knows,

42
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,235
in 2011 Tohoku experienced a large earthquake and tsunami

43
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:42,621
on March 11th, 2011.

44
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:49,299
The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant was

45
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:52,482
devastated by damage caused by flooding

46
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:56,667
as a result of the tsunami that resulted from the major earthquake.

47
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:59,563
The plant lost all its electrical power,

48
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:02,547
a severe accident occurred due to the

49
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:07,933
inability to cool down the nuclear reactor.

50
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:12,416
But actually, the closest power plant

51
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,110
to the epicenter of the earthquake

52
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,798
was the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant.

53
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,885
Surprisingly, at the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant

54
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:24,471
it was designed and built to take into account a rare event,

55
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,160
as a pre-requisite.

56
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,253
Tsunami countermeasures were considered as the most important matter

57
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:33,336
right from the beginning.

58
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:36,919
This was decided before building began.

59
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,301
Although for buildings in the 1970s,

60
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:43,989
the expected height of a tsunami

61
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,981
was 3 meters.

62
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,473
Two years prior, in 1968,

63
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:54,754
Tohoku electric power plant established a coastal research facility.

64
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:58,241
Due to the information they were receiving at that time,

65
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:01,833
the facility was built on ground 14.8 meters higher

66
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:06,416
than standard recommendations.

67
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,605
They took the decision to build it 15 meters higher

68
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:11,701
due to the importance of facility.

69
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:15,077
The reason for this extraordinary decision

70
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:18,767
was due to a former vice president of Tohoku electric power plant.

71
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:22,360
At that time, there was the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry,

72
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,472
whose director, Hirai Yanosuke,

73
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:28,356
was the head of the technical research institute.

74
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:34,235
He investigated the Sanriku earthquake of 869 AD,

75
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:36,727
which is said to have a magnitude of 8.7 or more,

76
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:40,214
with a tsunami accompanying it.

77
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:44,503
He argued that the provisions should be made

78
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:46,896
for a tsunami of this same scale.

79
00:04:46,896 --> 00:04:49,782
At that time, most people said that it was unnecessary

80
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:54,069
to think about establishing a site at such a height.

81
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,558
Thanks to Hirai's excellent foresight,

82
00:04:56,558 --> 00:05:00,743
the three nuclear reactors of the Onagawa nuclear power plant

83
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:07,721
were able to be shut down normally, even after the earthquake occurred.

84
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,608
Fortunately, because there was also no radiation leakage,

85
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:15,092
Hundreds of people at the facility

86
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:17,384
were able to be safely evacuated.

87
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,775
The damage that occurred at the Onagawa nuclear power plant was so small

88
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:25,961
which surprised many nuclear power experts around the world.

89
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:32,935
This was accomplished thanks to the decision-making of Hirai.

90
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:38,417
He made the decision and put into action

91
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:42,207
measures such as to prepare for a once in a thousand years situation.

92
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:48,385
While thinking about Engineering Ethics,

93
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:51,671
This is a perfect example of incredibly good decision making

94
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:55,361
and what can come as a result of that.

95
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:59,246
I think that this is an excellent example

96
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:01,534
which show the positive results.

97
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:02,509
Indeed.

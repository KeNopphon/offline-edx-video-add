1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,916
Moreover, about happiness,
Japanese constitution

2
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:19,219
states in its 13rd sentence.

3
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:24,524
Mr. Kono, have you ever had

4
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:28,629
opportunities to think about
happiness or well-being

5
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:32,232
in academic place

6
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:35,002
like high school

7
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,771
or university.

8
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,575
No, I have never had
opportunities to think about it

9
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,610
explicitly

10
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,645
I think.

11
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:47,447
You have been educated,

12
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:51,718
And I also attended schools,

13
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:58,191
but I also have never
had chance

14
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,895
to think about well-being

15
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,098
in junior high school,

16
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:09,202
high school, and university

17
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:15,676
at all. But

18
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,945
as we have seen,

19
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:21,415
a mission of tokyo
institution of industory

20
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,884
code of conduct in conference

21
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,286
states well-being

22
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:30,023
clearly in them.

23
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:34,361
And Aristole also
identifies it is important,

24
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,598
and japanese constitution

25
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,701
clearly mention it,

26
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,603
we have never thought about

27
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,306
well-being.

28
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,874
As you say,

29
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,411
We can see the word
"happiness" itself

30
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,880
in many places today.

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,317
Actually, the word
"well-being" is

32
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:01,722
noticed around the world.

33
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:10,230
For example,
the Pope published

34
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,833
the 10 clues to be happier,

35
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,702
many magazines are
interested in

36
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,138
well-being.

37
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:23,010
But when I start thinking
about well-being,

38
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,479
I realize

39
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,048
it is a little bit complicated.

40
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,851
Especially, when we pick up
Japan as an example,

41
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:34,621
it seems strange for me.

42
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,125
How about you, Mr. Kono.
What do you think about Japan.

43
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,994
for security, its power,

44
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,798
hospitality..

45
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,933
What do you think.

46
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,435
I personally think

47
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,737
Japan is comfortable
country to live,

48
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,672
Personally.

49
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:58,779
Our GDP is the third highest
followed America and China.

50
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,014
Japan is very
economically powerful,

51
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,752
and safe, and clean.

52
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:11,992
I have visited many
countries and cities

53
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,729
for the purpose of my business

54
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:20,534
Japan is really good to live.

55
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:25,405
But Leicester University
in Great Britain

56
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,808
in 2006, made world
happiness map,

57
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:31,445
according to the map,

58
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:35,282
Japan ranked at 90th
in the world.

59
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,783
90th... (laughing)

60
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:41,054
Yes, 90th. what do you think.

61
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,290
Don't you think it is strange.

62
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,524
(laughing)

63
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:49,496
OECD, which many
countries belong

64
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,733
to economic development,

65
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,001
international organization

66
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,605
sees countries through GDP,
which is macro

67
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,642
index, but

68
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:06,780
currently, they use

69
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,883
well-being indicators.

70
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:14,154
Strangely, OECD does not

71
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,390
make rankings about it unlike
the Lecester University.

72
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,627
But they shows
various items, like

73
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:25,065
income, housing,
and employment.

74
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:28,468
they research the average,

75
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,371
and how is each country

76
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,173
in OECD.

77
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,942
This is what they do.

78
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,144
They also have some
more interesteing,

79
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,213
This is very interesting,

80
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,817
but what I want you to see is

81
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,620
satisfaction of life.

82
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,556
Most countries in OECD are

83
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:55,162
developed countries,
so 59% of people

84
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,098
are satisfied with their life.

85
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:05,472
Though Japanese is
satisfied just only 40%.

86
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,942
This is weird.

87
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,746
Moreover,

88
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:17,350
Many people taking this course,

89
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,288
their parents

90
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,823
or

91
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,758
their grand parents,

92
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,494
they have worked for
the country hard

93
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,398
thanks to those effort,

94
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:37,137
and thanks to researchers in
Tokyo Institutions of Industory,

95
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,039
Thanks to everything
I mentioned,

96
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,975
Japan has been becoming rich.

97
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:45,278
blue line in this figure,

98
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:49,916
is about Japanese GDP.

99
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,955
it always increases, that is,
Japan becomes rich.

100
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,357
it shows.

101
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,161
However, satisfaction of life

102
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,630
orange line shows it,

103
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,167
it decreases.

104
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,470
Strange.

105
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,006
Aeconomist Easterlin

106
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,942
found out and he named it

107
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,944
Paradox of Easterlin.

108
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,646
It means

109
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,948
richer people become,

110
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:26,086
poorer their satisfaction
of life is.

111
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,521
This is paradox.

112
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,090
Yes.

113
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,628
In addition, the rate of
suiceide in Japan is

114
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:39,766
high compared to other
developed countries.

115
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:43,904
Japan is safe and clean, though,

116
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,807
poor satisfaction of life and

117
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,513
many people kill themselves.

118
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:57,083
it is strange.

119
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:02,555
And another data says,

120
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,993
the data is from
Japanese government,

121
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,931
richness of stuff or
richness of heart,

122
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,834
which is more important

123
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,104
the government asks Japanese
people every year

124
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:22,609
Unitil 1980, richness of
stuff isb more important

125
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,779
for them than richness of heart.

126
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,647
People think.

127
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,749
However, after 1980,

128
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,752
people think richness
of heart is

129
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,522
more important.

130
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,925
How about you, Mr. Kono.

131
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,294
Which do you think

132
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,496
it is more important for you.

133
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:48,768
I think, as you think,

134
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,770
richness of heart is
more important

135
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,173
even though we become
economically powerful.

136
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,341
(laughing)

137
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,275
I see.

138
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:59,179
Then, hou about

139
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,981
money or hapiness.

140
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,416
To become happier,

141
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,687
Do you think money is important.

142
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,056
If you do not have money,

143
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,258
you cannot get stuff
and become unhappy,

144
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,426
so, I think Money is important.

145
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:13,560
(laughing)

146
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,061
when I am asked to choose one,

147
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,464
I cannot choose actually.

148
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:23,470
Many people think
they need money

149
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,806
to be happy,

150
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:31,177
but many research shows

151
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:36,416
money, hapiness,
and satisfaction

152
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,687
do not relate to
each other much.

153
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,622
This is a result of statics

154
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,258
conducted in America ,

155
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:50,430
yearly income 35,000 dollers,
if we say 1 doller is worth 100 yen,

156
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:57,504
people who get less than
3,500,000 yen have

157
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,040
lower happiness in America.

158
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,410
However, income is 35,000
doller to 50,000 doller,

159
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,046
in short, even if your income
improve 35,000 to 50,000 dollers,

160
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,982
5,000,000yen to 10,000,000yen,

161
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,051
or over 10,000,000 yen,

162
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:15,155
hapiness is not improved much.

163
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:19,492
at least this data says.

164
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,328
Other studies shows

165
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,364
however, other result,

166
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,332
they conclude

167
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:31,304
we can see the relationship
between money and hapiness

168
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,640
a little bit,

169
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,311
So actually,
the studies are still going.

170
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,215
Let's see

171
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,318
how American people

172
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,920
answered

173
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,155
when they are asked,

174
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,824
this is multiple choice
questions though,

175
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,693
First,

176
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,229
this is the item
most people chose,

177
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,965
relationship with their children

178
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:03,303
Their children make
them happier,

179
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:09,342
77% of people chose it.

180
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,412
And friendship makes
them happier,

181
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:16,516
when they contribute to someone,

182
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:23,490
75% of people chose them.

183
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,258
4th is about husband or wife.

184
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,227
Or relationship with
their lover.

185
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:32,665
This makes people happier,
74 % of people chose it.

186
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,235
So first 4 items are important
when we consider

187
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,637
hapiness

188
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,540
first 4 items are what I
introduced now.

189
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,741
The answer is the relationships
among people

190
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,077
not money or stuff.

191
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,645
This is the answer.

192
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,281
How were these studies about

193
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:51,017
hapiness or well-being

194
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,020
started.

195
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,358
Of course,
studies about hapiness

196
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,193
is made long time ago,

197
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:04,564
era of Aristole,
or further before

198
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:08,635
in many countries or cultures.

199
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:16,209
Martin Segman is the first
person who started it

200
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:23,149
scientifically. He is an
psychologist in America.

201
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,487
He is a professor in the
University of Pensylvania

202
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,557
He is an experimental
psychologist.

203
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:36,996
He is a chairman in American
Psychology Association.

204
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:42,168
He was elected by
three times vote from

205
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,070
the second applicant,

206
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,908
then he was elected
as a chairman.

207
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,910
American Psychological
Asscociation

208
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,179
is the biggest asscociation

209
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,516
both in America and
in the world.

210
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,687
Professor Segliman

211
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:04,657
will have to

212
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,026
decide which way
psychology to go

213
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:11,097
in the future.

214
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,933
He had to state that.

215
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,003
what do you think
Professor Segliman said.

216
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:20,440
He said various things though,

217
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,141
in his keynote,

218
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:26,613
what he said is

219
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:30,083
A Psychology in America
contributed to

220
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,721
patients who awere told
never be cured

221
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,390
were told never be cured,

222
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,427
and made manuals to diagnose

223
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,764
people who have mental problems,

224
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,735
That is great,

225
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,337
he said.

226
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:55,475
And Professor Segliman continues

227
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:59,746
people who have mental
issue are at most

228
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:03,650
20-30 percent,

229
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,021
the rest of 70% live healthier

230
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,758
like Mr. Kono,

231
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:14,560
Psychology ishould
be for hose 70%

232
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,597
can live better,

233
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:21,134
we should use

234
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,637
intervention,

235
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,474
this is a technical term,

236
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,278
we should use intervention for

237
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,581
helthy people to live better.

238
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,950
He proposed. Professor Segliman

239
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,220
stated he named it
positive psychology

240
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,324
to people, then

241
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,559
The history of positive
psychology

242
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,163
has officially

243
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,633
started.

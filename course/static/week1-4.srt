1
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:13,765
Could you please

2
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:16,747
explain the importance of ethics

3
00:00:16,747 --> 00:00:18,843
not just in general

4
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:22,389
but as it related to science and technology?

5
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:27,273
In a nutshell, the relationship between science and technology

6
00:00:27,273 --> 00:00:30,664
and society is changing in significant ways.

7
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:34,243
To make it clearer,

8
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,838
let me give you

9
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:38,732
a little quiz.

10
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:42,329
Do you know what happened

11
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,406
on the four dates shown on this slide?

12
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,701
Let's see...

13
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:54,818
December 2nd, 1942, I think there was

14
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:56,610
there was something related to World War 2.

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,598
Right, there is some connection with the war.

16
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:07,873
However, there would be no exaggeration

17
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:10,264
to say that this is the most important day

18
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:12,258
in the history of mankind.

19
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:17,429
On that day, research on nuclear weapons began,

20
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:18,926
led by the United States and the United Kingdom.

21
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:20,726
It was known as

22
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:22,213
the Manhattan Project.

23
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:25,408
Enrico Fermi who fled from Italy

24
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:28,099
was one of the scientists

25
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:33,184
working on this project.

26
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,363
A secret laboratory, Metallurgical Laboratory,

27
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,462
was established at the University of Chicago

28
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:41,950
with a team of scientists.

29
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,939
It was the day of the first successful

30
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,532
controlled nuclear fission chain reaction.

31
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:52,909
In other words, that day marks the start of the Atomic Age.

32
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,502
Why is this related to ethics?

33
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:57,398
I will talk about this more later,

34
00:01:57,398 --> 00:01:59,492
but ethics, in principle,

35
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:02,284
is a behavioural science.

36
00:02:02,284 --> 00:02:04,771
If a behaviour or action is not possible

37
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:08,464
then it does not lead to ethical problems.

38
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:13,845
For example, time travel.

39
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:15,745
Currently, time travel is impossible for us.

40
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:18,632
We do not have a time machine that would let us travel in time.

41
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:22,020
So, concerns about whether time travel would be good or not

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,001
may be an interesting subject in

43
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:28,999
the field of science fiction, such as comics.

44
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:32,687
But right now, time travel is still impossible for us.

45
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:37,571
So, it does not present any

46
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:38,863
ethical problems for us to solve.

47
00:02:38,863 --> 00:02:40,454
Since it is an action we simply cannot perform.

48
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:44,401
But on December 2nd, 1942

49
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,188
mankind became capable of

50
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:49,179
using atomic energy.

51
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:53,164
From that day, we gained

52
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:55,059
that new ability.

53
00:02:55,059 --> 00:03:02,788
Why does it matter? Well, before that day

54
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:07,864
even if a leader of some country was planning

55
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:10,561
to obliterate mankind

56
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:15,441
they had no physical means to do it.

57
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:18,034
Even if they sprayed poison gas worldwide

58
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:22,118
it would not be enough to annihilate the human race.

59
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,311
But on December 2nd, 1942

60
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:30,095
we obtained a new source of tremendous energy

61
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:34,985
unlike anything we had known ever before.

62
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:36,588
atomic energy

63
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:41,767
And with it, we unlocked the possibility

64
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:45,656
to annihilate our own kind.

65
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:49,239
From that day

66
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,731
we have a new ethical issue to face.

67
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:57,619
The issue of whether it would be right or wrong

68
00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:01,609
to obliterate mankind.

69
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,084
That day marks

70
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:04,581
a momentous change in our world.

71
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:08,269
That's right. So, from my point of view

72
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,556
December 2nd, 1942

73
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:17,339
is the most memorable day

74
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,468
in human history.

75
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:25,839
Indeed. I know what happened on the next date, September 11th, 2001.

76
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,339
That's right.

77
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:32,522
A series of terrorist attacks took place then, as you know.

78
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,469
But what significance did they have?

79
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:41,351
You see,

80
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:47,234
scientists acting in good will, people like you,

81
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:52,028
engineers and technicians

82
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:57,510
used their knowledge to create a wonderful invention.

83
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,999
A passenger plane.

84
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:04,089
A plane designed to transport

85
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:07,776
as many people as possible, as fast as possible,

86
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:12,262
as far as possible, with comfort.

87
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:17,947
It was a good invention, but someone used it for a different purpose

88
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:19,744
and it leads to tragedy.

89
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:23,435
It showed us that an individual or a small group

90
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:25,427
are able to wage war

91
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:28,525
even against a super power like the USA,

92
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:31,610
or possibly even the whole world.

93
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,509
There is a bright and a dark side to science and technology.

94
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:39,091
This is what I mean by dual-use technology.

95
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:46,175
And it was illustrated for us by events that happened in front of our eyes.

96
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:51,135
The dual use of technology has been much discussed

97
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:54,118
by historians of science, scientists,

98
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:56,213
philosophers of science.

99
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:59,299
It was the topic in many debates.

100
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:05,288
But then, it became reality.

101
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:08,637
We saw it with our own eyes

102
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:12,553
on the screens of TVs,

103
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:14,544
in our living rooms.

104
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:19,533
So that's what September 11th, 2001 has taught us.

105
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:23,424
Next is June 13th, 2010.

106
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,213
I'm not sure about this one.

107
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:30,000
I've been talking about unsettling events thus far

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,289
but this time it is a positive one that I'd like to mention.

109
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:41,089
On that day the Japanese asteroid probe Hayabusa

110
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:45,873
which was sent to the asteroid Itokawa

111
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:48,969
successfully landed back on Earth.

112
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:50,763
So, what did we learn

113
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:56,554
on that day?

114
00:06:56,554 --> 00:07:03,138
We learned that our physical range of actions

115
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:08,225
can extend as far as 6 billion kilometres away from earth.

116
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:13,316
This is definitely something to be pleased with.

117
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:20,406
That day illustrated

118
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,596
the good side of science and technology.

119
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:27,142
I see. Lastly, we have March 11th, 2011.

120
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:30,104
It was a very memorable day

121
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:31,204
to all of us.

122
00:07:31,204 --> 00:07:36,593
Yes. As I mentioned earlier,

123
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:40,578
a big earthquake occurred along Japanâ€™s north-east Pacific coast.

124
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:43,968
An earthquake of the magnitude 9.0

125
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:48,657
was registered for the first time in Japan.

126
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:50,244
As you know,

127
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:53,734
the earthquake was followed by a tsunami

128
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:56,324
which in turn caused an accident at a nuclear power plant.

129
00:07:56,324 --> 00:08:00,617
Of course, the technical staff

130
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:04,902
working at that power plant

131
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,892
made the utmost effort

132
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:10,379
to ensure safety.

133
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:16,156
However, no matter how many precautions we make,

134
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:20,042
even if they seem to be working fine,

135
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:25,830
the forces of nature are so powerful

136
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,120
we can lose control of facilities.

137
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,706
This is what was made clear to us that day.

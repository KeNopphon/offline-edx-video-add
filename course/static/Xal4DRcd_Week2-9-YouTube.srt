1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
The Stakeholder

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
In the following part,
we will examine

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
the stakeholder in this case
study of Challenger disaster.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
In his interview,

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
Mr. Boisjoly stressed
repeatedly that

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
safety is far more
important for engineers

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
than their belonging
corporations,

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
or even himself.

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
Indeed, many ethical
mission statements

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
of scientific societies
and associations,

11
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
which write the important
value for engineers,

12
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
clearly state that

13
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
engineers must place
the top priority

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
on the value of
public safety,

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
health, and welfare.

16
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
In ethical policies, it is
stipulated for example,

17
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
that an engineer should take
responsibility for the
credibility

18
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
of the products'safety
he/she developed.

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
In this regard,

20
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
Mr. Boisjoly's strong
opposition to launch

21
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
was following the engineer's
ethics and policy.

22
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
At the same time, however,

23
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
the ethical statement
also requires

24
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
allegiance of engineers

25
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
to their employers
and clients.

26
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
In the case of Challenger,

27
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
the employer was
Morton-Thiokol Inc.

28
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
and the client was NASA.

29
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
Therefore, it was also
Mr. Boisjoly's obligation

30
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
to avoid conflict with his
employer and client,

31
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
and follow their directions.

32
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
Now, how do you judge

33
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
when such a conflict
between values arises?

34
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
We will examine

35
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,002
the ethical
decision-making process

36
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
to the detail in
the lecture 3.

37
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
For now, let me point out a
few examples.

38
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,017
What should engineers do

39
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
to make the best action

40
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,023
when you confront with

41
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,026
various ethical problems?

42
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,029
In the ethical
decision-making process,

43
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
it is essential for
engineers to consider

44
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
who would be affected

45
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,038
by your decision and
conducts.

46
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,041
To which extend you
could recognize

47
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,044
potential organizations
and events

48
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,980
that might be influenced by
your ethical decision,

49
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
is highly important.

50
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,986
Generally,
stakeholders include,

51
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,989
for example, yourself,
your family,

52
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,992
users, organizations
you belong to,

53
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,995
such as corporation

54
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,998
or a research institute,

55
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,001
your colleagues and
their families,

56
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,010
outside corporations in contract
with your organizations,

57
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
such as subcontractors
and suppliers

58
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,016
people belong to these
corporations,

59
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,022
the government and its
ministries and other agencies,

60
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,028
municipalities and
local residents,

61
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,031
related scientific
associations, and mass-media,

62
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,034
these are all stakeholders.

63
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,037
Thus, these persons and
organizations,

64
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,973
who may influence your
decision-making,

65
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,976
as well as those who may
be influenced by

66
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,979
your decision-making
and conducts,

67
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,982
directly or indirectly,

68
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,985
are called 'stakeholder'.

69
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
'Stakeholder' is a
significant notion

70
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,991
of engineer's ethics.

71
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,994
In Japanese, stakeholder is

72
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,997
often translated as

73
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000
'interested parties
and persons'.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,003
You might think

75
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,006
this means
financial interest,

76
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,009
but stakeholders are
not limited to

77
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,012
financial profit and loss.

78
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,021
This may lead
misunderstandings of

79
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,024
the notion and narrow
our discussion.

80
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
In this course, therefore,

81
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,030
we will use the
English word,

82
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,966
'stakeholder'.

83
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,978
In short, 'stakeholder'
should be defined as

84
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,981
someone/something who
may influence,

85
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,984
directly or indirectly,

86
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
on your ethical
decision-making and conducts

87
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,990
as well as those

88
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,993
who may be affected

89
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,996
by the decision and
conducts.

90
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,005
How can we distinguish
and specify

91
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,008
all the stakeholders we should
consider appropriately?

92
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,014
It's a good question.

93
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,017
There are several points

94
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,020
you should consider.

95
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,023
First, you should note that

96
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,960
there are strong stakeholders
and weak stakeholders.

97
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,963
For instance, for engineers,

98
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,966
product users and
clients are

99
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,969
important stakeholders.

100
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,972
They are weak stakeholders,

101
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,975
as they depend on
engineers and makers

102
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,978
in terms of the safety

103
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,981
of the products they use.

104
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,990
An example: engineers who design
aircrafts and passengers.

105
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,999
To understand to whom

106
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,002
you are responsible for,

107
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,005
it is important for
engineers

108
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:48,008
to consider weak
stakeholders.

109
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,014
Secondly, you
should note that

110
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,017
there are visible and
invisible stakeholders.

111
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,959
For instance, families
of users are

112
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,962
relatively invisible
stakeholders,

113
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,965
however, they should be
considered as well.

114
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,974
Here's another example:

115
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,977
the health hazard
caused by asbestos.

116
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,980
In this case, manufacture
of building materials

117
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,983
should consider stakeholders
beyond physical

118
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,986
or temporal proximity.

119
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,989
People living in
remote areas

120
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,992
and future users are

121
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,995
both your stakeholder.

122
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,001
By becoming aware of
the existence

123
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,004
of invisible stakeholders,

124
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,007
engineers are able to

125
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,010
recognize the stakeholders

126
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,946
properly and thoroughly.

127
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,955
When confronted with
a trouble,

128
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,958
we tend to be affected by
immediate problems.

129
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,961
We then tend to
consider only

130
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,964
visible, strong stakeholders

131
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,967
such as those in your
own organization.

132
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,973
This narrows your
perspective

133
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,976
and results in your failing

134
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,979
to make proper ethical
decision-making.

135
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,982
To avoid this,

136
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,985
it is essential for you

137
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,988
to carefully consider weak,

138
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,991
invisible stakeholders.

1
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:14,536
However,you propose the new idea 

2
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:18,250
ethics of technical experts based on their responsibility 

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,602
is not enough,

4
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:22,233
I would like to hear 

5
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:23,494
about more

6
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:25,045
specific details.

7
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:31,503
This idea is based on

8
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:33,934
discussions among people who study ethics in America, 

9
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:36,749
the discussions have 

10
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:39,829
made me realize

11
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:44,025
technical ethics might have limit,

12
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:47,520
technical ethics 1.0 means  

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,123
previous model of 

14
00:00:51,123 --> 00:00:53,902
technical ethic responsibility.

15
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:56,885
Let me make this clear, technical ethic 1.0 has

16
00:00:56,885 --> 00:01:00,519
strong character of like preventive ethic,

17
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,153
technicians are regarded as 

18
00:01:04,153 --> 00:01:07,833
provider of safe and health.

19
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:13,220
Mr. Kono is not a technician,

20
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,946
most of students 

21
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:19,971
who study engineering

22
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:24,233
are motivated to provide safe and health,

23
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:26,790
aren't they. 

24
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,702
They think they want to make something new,

25
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:32,436
they want to contribute to people

26
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:37,885
with science technology

27
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:40,650
in the future.

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,506
If we highlight the aspect of only preventitive ethic,

29
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:47,797
it might kill the hope to contribute to 

30
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:51,711
to people and society 

31
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,678
with science technology.

32
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:56,851
At least I can say the hope is not highlitened.

33
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,104
And

34
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:02,231
I will talk about it later though,

35
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:05,907
principles of technical ethics, that is 

36
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:09,867
protect profit people have , is highlitened

37
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:12,332
much all the time,

38
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,076
I have not been able to understand the tru meanings of profit.

39
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:17,753
However,

40
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:21,784
now, science make it possible 

41
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:27,478
to study profit scientifically, 

42
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:30,299
so now we should make it clear about profit.

43
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:36,339
Even more, there are a small problems in ethics.

44
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:39,762
small... no, it is kind of big problem.

45
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:43,620
Some says this is schzophrenie of ethics.

46
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,881
(laughing)

47
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,543
So I mean

48
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:55,190
when people think ethics,

49
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,317
they imagine an agent,action, and 

50
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:02,493
an outcome caused by the action.

51
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:07,356
Previous ethics tend to focus on 

52
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:12,292
the action and the outcome.

53
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:17,350
We call ethics focusing on an action

54
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,089
deontology,

55
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:24,126
which is proposed by Kant.

56
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:30,281
Ethics focusing on the outcome, which Mill and Bentham 

57
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,979
worked

58
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:37,298
have you ever heard of 

59
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:39,866
the greatest hapiness of the greatest number

60
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:42,565
, right, Mr. Kono.

61
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:47,597
From 18th to 20th century,

62
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:53,575
ethics was focusing on deontology 

63
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:58,754
and utilitarianism. However,

64
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:05,380
when focusing on the action and the outcome,

65
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,756
ethics might miss the agent,that is technicians here,

66
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:10,658
it might miss their motivation,

67
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:13,100
what is the technician like,

68
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,014
it cannot see things like that.

69
00:04:17,014 --> 00:04:22,864
when focusing on the action and the outcome, 

70
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:27,052
an action could be seen as either good or bad.

71
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:30,279
This is why it is called schizophrenia.

72
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,046
I noticed that.

73
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:37,713
consideration of ethics,

74
00:04:37,713 --> 00:04:40,383
focusing on an agent, that is a technician

75
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:45,331
is necessary, I noticed.

76
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:48,131
previous technical ethics, or technicians focusing on

77
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:51,182
preventive ethics highlight

78
00:04:51,182 --> 00:04:53,860
having special responsibility, like...

79
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,021
technicians ethics 1.0, as you said,

80
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:59,880
has problems, and we should find better model, I think.

81
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,288
The new model, 

82
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:05,974
how did you come up with the new idea.

83
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:11,916
I took some examples of accident and scandals

84
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,234
in my lectures, and 

85
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:17,181
technicians must not do this,

86
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:21,680
While I was teaching something like that, (laughing)

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,331
I was getting tired of teaching as well as students.

88
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:27,466
I would be introvert in the end.

89
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:30,120
some student told me if technicians are exposed to such a strict environment,

90
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,584
I do not want to be a technician.

91
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:37,464
This is how

92
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:42,413
I felt we should come up with 

93
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:47,346
a new model, and I discussed with some expertises

94
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,922
in  America,

95
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:54,555
The discussion made me realized that.

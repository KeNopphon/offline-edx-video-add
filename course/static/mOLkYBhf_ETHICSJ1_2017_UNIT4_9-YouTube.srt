1
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,598
So, what is positive psychology.

2
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:15,093
what on earth is positive psychology.

3
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:17,392
I know there are many definitions of it,though,

4
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:22,959
here is a definition, Professor Peggy Khan 

5
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:25,041
In the University of Melborn,

6
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:28,458
actually he is a friend of mine.

7
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:32,114
Here, I can see more definition other than him.

8
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:37,733
His definition says positive psychology is that

9
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:41,159
it finds factors for prosperity of individuals or communities

10
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,976
and how people do to promote these factors.

11
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,588
We can find

12
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:46,906
scientific studies the most important thing

13
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:52,108
in his definition.

14
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:54,528
Science is important.

15
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,208
well-being that philosophers ,religionists, 

16
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:03,596
and literary persons had insisted,

17
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,235
is well-living, but I think it is not true.

18
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:08,518
True meaning of positive psychology is 

19
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:10,570
to study well-being scientifically.

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,182
This is the correct definition.

21
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:17,671
And, here is slides made by 

22
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:19,581
Professor. Khan,

23
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,843
what positive psychology tells us is 

24
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:23,722
to switch our perspectives.

25
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:25,885
Previous psychology 

26
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:29,942
only helps people who have mental issues, 

27
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:34,206
and its objective is to kill the problems they have,

28
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:37,301
that is to make a situation problem-free.

29
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:41,296
This is previous psychology.

30
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:42,884
But,

31
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:44,944
on the other hand, positive psychology is

32
00:01:44,944 --> 00:01:49,844
meant for healthy people to live better.

33
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:53,658
Positive psychology requires

34
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:58,269
scientific studies in order to help people's life to be better.

35
00:01:58,269 --> 00:01:59,403
So what is 

36
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:01,865
the objectives of positive psychology.

37
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:04,497
What are those.

38
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:06,219
Does it mean that people become positive

39
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,258
and live  vigorously?

40
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:12,194
Some people thinks like that 

41
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:13,643
though,

42
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:16,669
I think a goal of positive psychology is

43
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,885
not limited to emotion, such as 

44
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:22,675
fun, happy, confortable. Not so simple.

45
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:26,582
Neither is just poitive thinking.

46
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:32,084
To define its goal in Japanese is a little difficult

47
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:34,117
though,

48
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:37,518
often said this is

49
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:41,106
flourish, not just hapiness.

50
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:42,861
Flourish is.

51
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:44,843
Flourish means,

52
00:02:44,843 --> 00:02:47,490
needless to say, it includes 

53
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,831
feelings like happy and fun,

54
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:53,586
but in addition, flourish implies the meanings that

55
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:56,611
I live fully, I am a part of the world,

56
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,725
I contribute to someone,

57
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:04,034
Flourish implies people live with these potential

58
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:06,453
all.

59
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:11,595
I believe this is the true meaning of flourish.

60
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:16,687
Flourish goes toward positive psychology. 

61
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:19,091
The goal is positive psychology.

62
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:20,655
But

63
00:03:20,655 --> 00:03:22,687
it is hard to find 

64
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:25,308
correct corresponding words in Japanese.

65
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:26,265
"Hanei(prosperity)" sounds odd for me, it is the closest word in Japanese, though.

66
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:27,378
(laughing)

67
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:29,326
I think it's totally different from flourish in English.

68
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:32,140
Professor. Peggy Khan says,

69
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,514
in his slides,

70
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:41,748
let's say these plants are 

71
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:44,890
people.

72
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,697
People live vigorously 

73
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:50,114
this is the meaning of flourish.

74
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:52,498
But sadly,

75
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,641
this is what happens in Japan.

76
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:56,810
they are dead.

77
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,487
people are always alone, even when they are in the train,

78
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:05,393
they gaze their smartphones, they never talk to someone,

79
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:08,238
they seem introvert persons.

80
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:11,319
Anyway, positive psychology has

81
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,522
changed previous psychology

82
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,367
to more hapiness models.

83
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:25,991
While previous psychologists made a manual

84
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:30,764
for people having mental issues and disabilities

85
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:34,473
to diagnose them, positive psychologists thought

86
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:39,166
what are strengths and good point of people,

87
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:45,385
across countries, what characters or attitudes 

88
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:49,843
people will be respected, like virtue.

89
00:04:49,843 --> 00:04:52,959
Or, what are strengths of character. 

90
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,312
These are the manual they have made.

91
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,460
So, let me repeat the important things he

92
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,754
it was changed from pathological model to

93
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:03,613
hapiness model.

94
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:10,930
Today, so called fuctional MRI, MEG, devices, which can image 

95
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:18,060
various aspects of our brain

96
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,252
has appeared.

97
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:25,274
neuro science is also developing, 

98
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:29,077
positive psychologists work with scientists who

99
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:32,334
study neuro science.

100
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:35,644
This is brand-new work.

101
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:41,933
For example, a research announced 

102
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:44,711
in The University of Tokyo a few years ago,

103
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:50,685
showed where brain processes satisfaction

104
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,748
for the first time.

105
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:58,177
A research announced in the University of Kyoto

106
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:03,327
shows where is the mental basis in the brain 

107
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:07,784
when people feel happy. These are outcomes of the work.

108
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,079
People started to study well-being 

109
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,802
scientifically,

110
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:15,523
and some outcomes has just appeared now, 

111
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:17,214
but how these outcomes are used, 

112
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:20,726
only in academic study.

113
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:24,808
No No, they are used 

114
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:27,858
in various purposes.

115
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:30,332
For example, U.S. army uses them

116
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:35,345
not only for their army,

117
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:36,993
but also for families of their army,

118
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:40,042
and their relatives.

119
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:43,777
Not only for physical fitness

120
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:46,082
but also for emotional fitness.

121
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:48,015
And for social fitness,

122
00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:49,931
for fitness of family relation

123
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:51,625
for spiritual fitness, as well.

124
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,156
They call these fitness

125
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:55,937
comprehensive soldier fitness

126
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,026
as one thing

127
00:06:57,026 --> 00:07:01,010
They hold a program to improve their cpmprehensive soldier fitness 

128
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,096
to all people related to army.

129
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:09,405
Who made the program is

130
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:12,170
Seligman.

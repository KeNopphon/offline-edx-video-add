Seven Steps Guide 4

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,012
Now, let us give a test

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
on the actions we
have listed

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
in the mini-case.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
Considering the
limitation of time,

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
we will examine their
ethical value

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
through the
Reversibility test and

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
the Universalization test.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
How do you evaluate
the action

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
with the Reversibility test?

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
Well, if my grand
parents are

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
working in farming
downriver,

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
I doubt if I follow

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
the chief manager's
instruction.

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
Or, you can imagine

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
if your parents are perhaps

17
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
living downstream.

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
Then, at least you cannot

19
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
blindly obey the
instruction.

20
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
That's right. The
reversibility test reveals

21
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
that the Action Plan
1, following

22
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
the chief's instruction and
releasing the contents

23
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
to river, to be ethical
inappropriate.

24
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
Now, how about with the
Universalization test?

25
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
If all the engineers
in the world would

26
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
only follow the instruction,

27
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
despite having
concern on the harm

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
it does to the environment,

29
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
then what happens?

30
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
Engineers will lose
people's trust,

31
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
and inconsistencies
arise in the society.

32
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
Therefore, the act of

33
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
obeying the chief's
instruction blindly,

34
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
is ethically denied also

35
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
by the
universalization test.

36
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
Yes. As we have seen,
in the Step 5,

37
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
you will examine ethical
appropriateness of

38
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
your action through
various tests.

39
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
I believe, just knowing the
conceptual framework

40
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
of the six tests helps
a lot for us

41
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
to design our
behavior as engineer.

42
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
Indeed, the ethic tests are

43
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,002
introduced to corporate
activities as a way

44
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
to encourage employee's
ethical behaviors.

45
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
Corporations such as
Lockheed Martin

46
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,011
and Texas Instruments
have their

47
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,014
own ethics tests.

48
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,017
Here, I will
briefly refer to

49
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
the ethics test of the
Texas Instrument,

50
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,023
a corporation well known

51
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,026
for its good ethical
practices.

52
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
The Texas Instrument's
ethics quick test lists

53
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
the following questions:

54
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,038
'Does the action legal?',

55
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,041
'Does it comply

56
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,044
with the Texas
Instruments' values?',

57
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,980
'If you do it,

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
will you feel bad?',

59
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,986
'How will it look in
the newspaper?'

60
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,989
and 'If you know it's wrong,

61
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,992
don't do it!'

62
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,004
Beneath the quick
test, it reads:

63
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,007
if you are uncertain
about something,

64
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,010
consult it with your boss

65
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
or Ethics Contact

66
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,016
till you are fully
convinced.

67
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,025
The ethical tests are
printed on a card,

68
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,028
which every employee of
Texas Instruments is

69
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,031
carrying at all times.

70
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,037
Yes, an employee of the
company brings,

71
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,973
besides his/her
employee ID card,

72
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,976
an ethic card.

73
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,979
On the front side you
read the ethical code

74
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,982
of the company, and the
quick test stands

75
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,985
on the back.

76
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
Now, in the Step 6,
you will review

77
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,991
your measure based on
steps 1 to 5.

78
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,997
You make a final
choice based on

79
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000
the former
considerations on

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,003
possible actions
you may take.

81
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,012
It is also possible

82
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,015
a completely different
option comes

83
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,018
under consideration
at this point.

84
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,021
When you make the
final decision

85
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,024
at step 6, you might
think you have done

86
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
through the whole process
of decision-making.

87
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,030
However, the Seven
step guide has

88
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,966
one more important step,

89
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,969
step 7.

90
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,972
In the step 7,

91
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,975
you consider how
you could reduce

92
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,978
the likelihood that
you will need

93
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,981
to make a similar
decision again.

94
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,984
You should also think how
you could solve

95
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
the problem of your
situation

96
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,990
and improve your
organization,

97
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,993
by re-examining

98
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,996
the former steps
from 1 to 6.

99
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,999
What is the significance
of the step 7?

100
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,005
One thing is, of course,

101
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,008
it is beneficial to
think once again

102
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,011
if it is really good to
take that action.

103
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,014
But more important
than that,

104
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,017
it is significant to
work out a plan

105
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,020
how you could avoid falling

106
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,023
in a similar situation.

107
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,960
Of course it is
possible that

108
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,963
there would be nothing
you could do.

109
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,966
But, there might be a way to
change the organization

110
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,969
to prevent the
problem. For instance,

111
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,972
improving the atmosphere at
your workplace

112
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,975
to encourage employees

113
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,978
to consult difficult
situations with others,

114
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,981
or providing better support
from the ethics consultant,

115
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,984
this would change the
whole situation.

116
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,987
It is thus an essential step
to design measures

117
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,990
to prevent falling in a
similar ethical problem.

118
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,993
Furthermore, re-examining
your situation

119
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,996
not only from a micro

120
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,999
but from a macro
point of view

121
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,002
leads you to consider
in which way

122
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,005
the organizations or
systems should change.

123
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,017
Referring to the 4 levels of
engineering ethics

124
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,953
we have studied in the
beginning of this class,

125
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,959
you can say that the
step 7 is where

126
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,962
you move from the
micro viewpoint

127
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,965
to the mezzo point of view.

128
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,968
In a real situation,

129
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,971
you might have not
enough time

130
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,974
to follow the whole steps.

131
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,977
However, following the 7
Steps guide,

132
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,980
a longer, careful
consideration is crucial,

133
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,983
especially for a
prevailing problem

134
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,986
that may cause an
enormous impact.

135
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,995
The guide is also
helpful to look back

136
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,998
on actions you took.

137
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,004
Of course, the 7
Steps guide cannot

138
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,007
solve all the ethical
problems.

139
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,946
It is just a guideline
you can follow,

140
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,949
which enables you to
carefully consider

141
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,952
before you come to a
decision

142
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,955
how you act.

143
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,961
However, it is helpful

144
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,964
not to jump to an
impulsive conclusion

145
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,967
but to think thoroughly,

146
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,970
even when you have to make

147
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,973
an ethical decision

148
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,976
in a complicated situation.

149
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,982
You can improve your ability

150
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,985
in ethical decision-making
by examining

151
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,988
different previous cases
according to the guideline

152
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,991
and by experiencing

153
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,994
the decision-making
processes

154
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,997
by yourself.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,003
I want you to think about,

156
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,939
what if you were
in these cases,

157
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,942
how you could make your
ethical decision.

    "Engineer's Ethics (2)", 
    "To which social groups", 
    "do engineers belong to?", 
    "First, engineers belong to", 
    "an organization; a corporation or", 
    "an enterprise in most cases.", 
    "This social group has its", 
    "ethical principles or standards of conduct.", 
    "They parade a motto", 
    "to the society,", 
    "showing how they act and behave.", 
    "Second, engineers also", 
    "belong to professions,", 
    "including academic societies and", 
    "professional associations.", 
    "The profession has", 
    "its own ethical principles,", 
    "which explain", 
    "how its members should", 
    "act to the society.", 
    "And finally, engineers belong to", 
    "the society in a broader context.", 
    "Therefore,", 
    "engineers belong to several social groups,", 
    "which can be divided into six layers, and", 
    "each social group has", 
    "its own specific standards of conducts", 
    "that should be considered.", 
    "It ranges from the values", 
    "and standards of an individual to", 
    "that of a constituent member", 
    "of the entire humankind.", 
    "In this course,", 
    "we should pay particular attention", 
    "to the third point:", 
    "value and standards of conduct", 
    "as a member of an occupational group.", 
    "Usually this is", 
    "directly related", 
    "to business ethics and", 
    "corporate social responsibility.", 
    "And the fourth point,", 
    "value and standards of conduct", 
    "as a member of a group with professional skills,", 
    "is the engineer's ethics.", 
    "So far we have discussed the notion of 'ethics'.", 
    "Next, we will consider the other term of", 
    "the 'engineer's ethics', namely the 'engineering',", 
    "because an engineer is the one who practice the technology.", 
    "What is 'engineering'?", 
    "There are many definitions of 'engineer'.", 
    "An American Encyclopedia", 
    "defines 'engineer' as a profession.", 
    "{The definition in the encyclopedia shown in English on the slide}", 
    "Traditional profession includes", 
    "medical doctors and lawyers.", 
    "Engineers are also regarded to be", 
    "highly intellectual, professional occupation.", 
    "What kind of professional occupation", 
    "is engineer?", 
    "Engineering is the profession", 
    "that applies the knowledge of natural sciences and", 
    "various practices to economically utilize", 
    "the materials and forces of the nature for the benefit of humankind.", 
    "This has to be done with judgment.", 
    "As doctors make decision about", 
    "what kinds of treatment", 
    "should be applied to a patient,", 
    "engineers judge", 
    "how the natural forces", 
    "should be applied for the benefit of humankind.", 
    "Engineers practically involve themselves", 
    "in this process of judgment and application.", 
    "Here arises a big problem.", 
    "Even when we accept", 
    "this definition I just explained,", 
    "it still remains undefined", 
    "what is the benefit of mankind.", 
    "Many people say that", 
    "engineering is neutral,", 
    "value free.", 
    "For instance, they say that", 
    "the production of a well-cut knife is", 
    "value free.", 
    "But the act of", 
    "injure with the knife is", 
    "a bad conduct.", 
    "While, a creation of artistic sculpture with the same knife", 
    "is considered to be a good conduct.", 
    "The act of using the knife can be right or wrong,", 
    "but the production of the knife itself is value free.", 
    "This is a popular idea about engineering.", 
    "But, I disagree with this claim", 
    "as it seems not effective today any more.", 
    "Indeed, as the history has seen,", 
    "science technology has produced a great impact on humankind.", 
    "So, the question of value arises", 
    "already when you decide which technology you would employ.", 
    "Engineering and values are", 
    "rather inseparable from each other.", 
    "What kind of technology", 
    "would you face with?", 
    "Which technology would you use?", 
    "These decisions reflect the value of", 
    "an individual, corporation or organization.", 
    "Combining the definitions of the two terms,", 
    "'engineering' and 'ethics',", 
    "I define 'engineering's ethics' as follows:", 
    "\"Engineering's ethics is a body of normative system", 
    "in a social group that engineers should follow", 
    "when they form a judgment on their conduct", 
    "and on related values of applying their knowledge of", 
    "the mathematical and natural sciences", 
    "gained by study, experience,", 
    "and practice,", 
    "in order to economically utilize", 
    "the materials and forces of", 
    "the nature for the benefit of mankind.\"", 
    "How does the 'engineer's ethics'", 
    "differ from that of general public?", 
    "In this respect,", 
    "it is important to notice that", 
    "technology produces a new value.", 
    "Let me give an example. Fifty or sixty years ago,", 
    "if you say you are interested in", 
    "somebody else's internal organs,", 
    "people would say you are crazy.", 
    "However, in the contemporary society", 
    "where we have immunosuppressive drugs and", 
    "organ transplantation technologies,", 
    "somebody else's organs that used to be valueless", 
    "can be valuable for a patient", 
    "suffering from liver disease,", 
    "if the liver would be compatible", 
    "to his/her body.", 
    "Thus,", 
    "technology gave a new value", 
    "to human body's organs.", 
    "Another example.", 
    "In 1932, James Chadwick", 
    "at the Cavendish Laboratory of", 
    "the University of Cambridge", 
    "discovered the neutron.", 
    "Before his discovery,", 
    "an atom with a big nucleus", 
    "emitting natural radiation, such as uranium,", 
    "had been regarded", 
    "worth a subject of scientific study.", 
    "But no one recognized its other potential values.", 
    "However, once Leo Szilard and", 
    "his fellow physicists discovered", 
    "the mechanism of neutron chain reaction,", 
    "which occurs when one single nuclear reaction causes", 
    "one or more subsequent nuclear reactions,", 
    "scientists realized", 
    "they could apply", 
    "this mechanism of releasing", 
    "vast quantities of energy", 
    "using neutrons to other purposes,", 
    "such as nuclear weapons.", 
    "Therefore,", 
    "science and technology produce", 
    "a new value,", 
    "and only engineers", 
    "working in the forefront", 
    "can recognize the emergence of", 
    "this new value.", 
    "And it is only engineers", 
    "who can design appropriate acts", 
    "and conducts how to use the innovative technology,", 
    "carefully balancing between", 
    "the new and existing values.", 
    "In this regard, engineer's ethics has", 
    "a particular responsibility."

    "Value and Ethical Codes for Engineers", 
    "The 7 Steps guide is a general guideline", 
    "for ethical decision-making.", 
    "It is not only for engineers, but also", 
    "for broader range of people in various occupations.", 
    "However, as we have discussed in previous lesson,", 
    "there's a special requirement for engineering ethics:", 
    "engineers must recognize new values", 
    "created by innovative technologies and", 
    "balance it with existing values.", 
    "Now, what are the values that", 
    "engineers should consider particularly?", 
    "There are ethics tests designed", 
    "especially for professions.", 
    "They examine the adequacy of an action", 
    "an engineer is about to take,", 
    "in light of the ethical values", 
    "that are particularly important for engineering profession.", 
    "Strictly speaking, what ethical values engineers", 
    "should put particular emphasis should be discussed", 
    "not only by engineers but also with all the stakeholders", 
    "including end-users who benefit", 
    "from the technological development.", 
    "Unfortunately, there is no such a", 
    "discussion platform at this moment.", 
    "Instead, the ethical codes propounded", 
    "by the scientific societies", 
    "and associations play that part.", 
    "In Europe and especially in the United States,", 
    "engineers' ethical values are often explained", 
    "by the social contract model.", 
    "The social contract model is", 
    "closely related to the European university system", 
    "established in the 12th century", 
    "and based on the notion of", 
    "'learned profession'.", 
    "Traditionally, European societies acknowledged", 
    "and fostered the 'learned profession'", 
    "with highly professional knowledge and", 
    "skills such as priests, medical doctors,", 
    "and lawyers.", 
    "Like these traditional professions, engineers tried", 
    "to build and maintain a relationship of trust", 
    "with society so that they would achieve", 
    "higher social recognition.", 
    "To be acknowledged as profession,", 
    "the group needs to state", 
    "a mission statement to the society.", 
    "So, like the Hippocratic Oath for the physicians,", 
    "associations of engineers compounded an oath", 
    "to state to what kinds of values they serve.", 
    "Having and observing an ethical code was a basic need", 
    "to be respected as profession in a society.", 
    "So, engineers considered what they should write", 
    "in the engineer's ethical code.", 
    "There are many opinions about ethical codes.", 
    "Indeed, philosopher John Radd was skeptical of ethical codes.", 
    "Radd pointed out that 'ethic' is a notion", 
    "that evades universal definition.", 
    "It is an open-ended concept", 
    "that has no one-and-only definition.", 
    "Therefore, it is the confusion of 'mathematical'", 
    "and 'ethical' solution to find an answer", 
    "based on the ethical codes.", 
    "This oversimplifies the observance of ethical codes", 
    "to achievement of moral discipline.", 
    "Others consider the ethical codes", 
    "not as rules but rather as a guideline", 
    "that leads engineers to make decisions.", 
    "The ethical codes are the embodiment of knowledge", 
    "and experiences accumulated by preceding engineers.", 
    "It serves as a proper guideline for current", 
    "and prospective engineers at their duties", 
    "on their decision-making process.", 
    "The ethical codes play a significant role", 
    "in that they encourage awareness of the responsibilities", 
    "of engineering and normalization", 
    "of engineer's ethical conducts.", 
    "Other scholars, including Michael Davis,", 
    "place put a far more greater emphasis on ethical codes.", 
    "According to Davis, the ethical codes should be", 
    "regarded as contract between professions.", 
    "An ethical code is a social contract", 
    "between profession and society.", 
    "In consideration for their fulfillment", 
    "of specialized services that are essential for the health,", 
    "safety and well-being of people and its society,", 
    "which cannot be performed by other individuals,", 
    "the society gives high reputations towards engineers", 
    "and grant substantial autonomy to the profession.", 
    "To maintain this mutually beneficial relationship,", 
    "profession needs to construct a strict ethical code.", 
    "At the same time, ethical codes are contract", 
    "between the professional engineers,", 
    "which foster and enable mutual cooperation", 
    "between professionals.", 
    "This mutual cooperation between the professionals", 
    "makes it possible for them to oppose bigger pressures", 
    "that you cannot resist alone.", 
    "Ethical codes protect individual engineers", 
    "from an undesired pressure, for instance,", 
    "to force them to skip some working procedure", 
    "to save financial costs.", 
    "", 
    "Ethical code gives a foundation for engineers", 
    "to protest against such pressures", 
    "not only as moral practitioners but also", 
    "as professionals with skills and knowledge.", 
    "As a contract between professionals,", 
    "composition of ethical code is an embodiment", 
    "of the common ideals shared by the members of profession,", 
    "or the oath they swear each other.", 
    "The establishment and observance of ethical codes are", 
    "autonomous behavior of professionals.", 
    "While the understanding of ethical code", 
    "as a social contract emphasizes", 
    "the engineer's powerful influence on the society,", 
    "ethical code as a contract between professions stresses", 
    "the internal norm and standard of the profession of engineers.", 
    "One focuses on the external factors", 
    "and the other looks at internal factors.", 
    "These two interpretations of ethical codes are", 
    "not mutually exclusive,", 
    "rather complementary to each other.", 
    "As we have seen, in short,", 
    "ethical codes have different functions.", 
    "Let's have a brief look on", 
    "how engineering associations' ethical codes", 
    "have been constructed.", 
    "In the United States, the first ethical codes of engineering", 
    "was propounded in the 1910s with a model", 
    "of ethical codes established by physicians in 1847.", 
    "The American Institute of Electrical Engineers", 
    "made the first engineering codes of ethics in 1912.", 
    "The early codes of ethics aimed at", 
    "achieving a high social status approved to physicians.", 
    "Therefore, engineers were", 
    "treated as individual professionals", 
    "who serve their clients independently,", 
    "rather than as a mere member of organization.", 
    "These early codes emphasized", 
    "professional ethics of engineers", 
    "and stipulated values such as allegiance, obedience,", 
    "and the professional skills.", 
    "After the WWII, scientific societies", 
    "and associations revised their ethical codes", 
    "of engineers for several times.", 
    "In addition to engineer's responsibility", 
    "for employers and clients, their responsibility", 
    "for public began to be recognized.", 
    "After a half an century,", 
    "the engineer's mission for the public was", 
    "stipulated in the ethical codes.", 
    "Furthermore, in 1974,", 
    "a union of scientific associations", 
    "established the ethical codes that gives priority", 
    "to the the engineer's responsibility for public", 
    "over their responsibility", 
    "towards employers and clients.", 
    "This code of ethics for engineers", 
    "established by the National Society of Professional Engineers", 
    "was adopted by many other societies and associations,", 
    "becoming a standard model of such codes.", 
    "Next, we will examine important values", 
    "stated in these code of ethics for engineers."

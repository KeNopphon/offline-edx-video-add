00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
How to act as engineer
on the site (2)

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,012
Look at the chart of the vendor,
Morton-Thiokol.

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
At the stage A, he consulted

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
his immediate boss,
J. R. Kapp.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
Mr. Boisjoly is indicated

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
with pink color.

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
The chief executive of
engineering

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
was the vice
president, R. Lund.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
Here's A. Thompson,

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
supervising engineer,

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
who did the experiment
with Boisjoly.

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
Boisjoly formed an
unofficial team

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
with Thompson and
other engineers

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
to conduct experiments, and

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
reported the results
to his bosses

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
numerous times.

17
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
He proposed as many as 33

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
alternative designs
of field joint.

19
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
However, the senior
management

20
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
did not recognize its
significance.

21
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
At the end of July 1985,

22
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
they still did not seem

23
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
to take any counter-measures.

24
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
Getting impatient at
the situation,

25
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
Boisjoly wrote a memorandum.

26
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
With Kapp's approval,
he handed it

27
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
to the chief
executive, Lund.

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
In the memorandum, Mr.
Boisjoly wrote:

29
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
"It is my honest and
very real fear

30
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
that if we do not take
immediate action

31
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
to dedicate a team to
solve the problem

32
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
with the field joint

33
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
having the number
one priority,

34
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
then we stand in jeopardy of

35
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
losing a flight along with

36
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
all the launch pad
facilities."

37
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
This memorandum

38
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
led the company reluctantly

39
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
to take action.

40
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,002
In August 1985, an
official team

41
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
was formed to
solve the problem,

42
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
but, the limited support

43
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,011
from the company resulted in

44
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,014
no substantial solution.

45
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,017
The team proposed 15
experiments,

46
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
none of which was realized.

47
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,029
Without support
from the company,

48
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
the O-ring Task Force
could do nothing

49
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
before December 1985.

50
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,038
Stage C: what would you do
in that situation?

51
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,044
1) Suggest to the vice
president engineer

52
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,980
to provide more resources

53
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
to the Task Force;

54
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,986
2) Report to scientific
societies that

55
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,989
the company does not support

56
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,992
Task Force despite of

57
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,995
its safety matter;

58
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,998
3) Record your daily
activities

59
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,001
and observations on
a logbook;

60
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,007
4) Continue working under

61
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,010
the provided condition

62
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
following the
company's policy;

63
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,016
5) Take some other actions

64
00:03:39,019 --> 00:00:00,000
These are actions
you may take.

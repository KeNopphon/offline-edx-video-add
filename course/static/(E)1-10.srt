1
00:00:11,113 --> 00:00:15,029
As I mentioned earlier, when talking about Macro Ethics,

2
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,145
I showed a chart with a rather bleak forecast of the future.

3
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:21,004
But of course, we must face reality

4
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:25,483
because we need to determine what causes

5
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,674
issues such as this one.

6
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:32,802
One of the causes is obviously, in a certain sense, hazards

7
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:37,013
use and application of technological advancements.

8
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:41,512
But, on the other hand, I am of the opinion that

9
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:46,261
it is only scientists and engineers that can solve

10
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:49,311
these issues that face mankind.

11
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:50,762
That is the one thing

12
00:00:50,762 --> 00:00:54,278
that has come from this focus on ethics. What kind of initiatives are there?

13
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:57,174
in terms of taking a practical stance on ethics?

14
00:00:57,174 --> 00:01:00,960
As I mentioned earlier, I have been noticing that,

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,949
and this is to do with the National Academy of Engineering in the U.S.,

16
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:06,805
there is a project called the Grand Challenges

17
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:07,298
which is promoted heavily there.

18
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:11,654
Grand Challenges for Engineering

19
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,908
is a project run by the Academy

20
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:19,348
where they seek to clarify what exactly

21
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:22,780
the most serious and important tasks that engineers have to solve are.

22
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,839
In addition to carrying out various systematic investigations,

23
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:29,340
in terms of reaching a resolution, along with promoting education,

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,659
it is a project which

25
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,068
aims to engage the entire scientific community.

26
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:39,904
So, as shown in this slide,

27
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:47,788
there are currently 14 areas that Grand Challenges are working on now.

28
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:51,382
So really, as Mr. Kono said just now,

29
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:56,319
this initiative can be thought of as

30
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:01,042
an appeal for ethics. If you look at the education center

31
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:03,227
in Indiana, for example,

32
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:05,457
it's at a university called Purdue University.

33
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:09,224
There are students who study at its School of Engineering and Technology,

34
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:12,766
Students who, when just entering university,

35
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,951
for example, on a mechanical or electrical engineering course,

36
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:19,751
instead of specializing in the first year,

37
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:24,384
they study a common curriculum which covers

38
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,009
for example, mathematics or design elements.

39
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:33,743
It's that kind of education. During the course of the first year,

40
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:41,499
professional teachers such as those specializing in mechanical engineering, for example,

41
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:45,912
visit but don't tell you how to learn mechanical engineering.

42
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:49,243
Instead, you are to become an engineer

43
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:52,831
who can make a contribution to

44
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:55,430
an area of Grand Challenges. Soâ€¦

45
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,348
it is an education which focuses on,

46
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:04,397
as opposed to scholarly learning,

47
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:07,231
turning you into an engineer who can resolve

48
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:11,337
issues that are affecting humans today. 

49
00:03:11,337 --> 00:03:15,456
The educational intent and style are changing.

50
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:18,738
From focusing on specialized fields,

51
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:21,820
to rather developing engineers in the direction of

52
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:29,147
being able to solve issues which affect mankind. I think it can be said that

53
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:32,769
there is a clear intention

54
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,459
being shown here.

55
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,459
the real meaning is not to provide an education based around

56
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:45,068
learning technical and specialist knowledge.

57
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:50,165
Rather, it is an education to promote and nurture true engineers.

58
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:54,629
Even if you look at from a purely ethics-oriented point of view,

59
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,410
I think it can be said that

60
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,777
this is an extremely impressive effort. Furthermore,as this is to do with

61
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:07,432
solving problems which affect humanity as a whole,

62
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:11,807
this means we are training the kinds of engineers

63
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:15,208
who will make a contribution to society than to themselves.

64
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:19,346
I am going in this direction,

65
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:24,638
but this is topic will be covered later in this course.

66
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:27,434
I'm talking about an area called positive psychology.

67
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,831
So, what does it take to feel fulfilled in life,

68
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:34,818
from a positive psychology point of view?

69
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:37,692
Subjectively, you could say "well-being".

70
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:41,013
I have been told that sense of well-being

71
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:45,755
is achieved through

72
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:48,497
contributing to something greater than yourself.

73
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,242
While I understand that this improves

74
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:55,459
one's sense of well-being.

75
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:00,366
If you think about engineers who work

76
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,347
to try solve the problems that face human beings...

77
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:05,654
I think that we could say that

78
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:10,858
those engineers are contributing

79
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:13,799
not only to the whole human race,

80
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:16,362
but also to their own happiness.

Seven Step Guide part 2

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,560
Let's proceed to step 1.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,680
Step 1 is to clarify ethical issues

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:26,400
In this step, it is important to clarify what kind of problems you are facing

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,020
In this case study,  if you follow the manager's order

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,440
And if for instance it contains something bad for the environment

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,520
we will not meet the value held for public safety.

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,620
At the same time, we can not meet the expected organizational loyalty and value

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,840
If you do not follow the instructions given by your boss.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,480
You are facing what is called the
"Dilemma Problem."

11
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,920
As you mentioned, ethical issue can be classified into two types.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,040
The dilemma problem and demarcation problem.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,180
Yes, that is correct.

14
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,120
Try using easy words to explain the problem that you are facing

15
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:15,740
without thinking about the dilemma being faced.

16
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,380
I think this is the most important thing to do.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,460
Step 2 is considering facts

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,640
Of course, there are known facts,

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,380
unclear facts as well as points of speculation

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,960
clarifying and considering which facts are needed to examine ethical issues.

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,760
In this mini case, the facts known are clear.

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,340
As for a fact to be considered such as what is the

23
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:50,600
the content of the drum. What is inside ?

24
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,200
Whether the drum belongs to the company

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,420
Whether or not there is another method to find out what the contents are.

26
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,920
Has the company experienced a similar case in the past

27
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,339
Whether the section chief only  knows about this fact

28
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,520
These issues need to be investigated.

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,780
In Step 3

30
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,520
In this step, you are required to identify the relevant factors.

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
Professor, what sort of factors should be taken into consideration

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,940
Firstly, those who will be affected by your decision-making.

33
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,100
The stakeholders.
What type of stakeholders are out there?

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,220
You need to think about it

35
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,660
and values which the stakeholders hold.

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,360
It is necessary to think  what the stakeholders are considering.

37
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,180
In addition, there are relevant laws

38
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,873
What kind of related laws exist

39
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:58,542
must be determined.

40
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:02,702
there are many academic societies related to specific fields

41
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:07,760
There you should also refer to such codes of ethic they have.

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,220
Therefore, as an Engineer it is important to understand what the values are

43
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,880
and is it necessary to re-organize the values again.

44
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,640
In the case of this mini case, the stakeholders are the chief and yourself.

45
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:30,544
In addition, your  family, colleagues,

46
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:35,841
Residents living by the basin of the river, or

47
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:39,191
supervisors managing the rivers such as

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,799
local governments and or departments

49
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,680
Also, such as the ministries of the government  and agencies.

50
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,494
All these may be referred to as stakeholders.

51
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:53,090
I think that can be said. The fact is

52
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,700
when you think how the actions you take

53
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,260
can have an impact on the environment governed by laws and regulations in the region

54
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,780
I think it is an important factor as well.

55
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,780
Given the guide, step 4 contains the list.

56
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,160
According to Prof. Davis, there should be at least five action options.

57
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,640
I agree. Coming up with five can be quite difficult.

58
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,060
The important point here is to think about it

59
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,840
for example, to follow or to not follow instructions.

60
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,600
Rather

61
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,060
Based on the information obtained in the previous step

62
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:39,380
consider who to consult with, what should you say,...

63
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,280
Now let's list some of the action plans

64
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,020
from the previous case study.

65
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,780
Well Kono-san, could you think of the possible actions?

66
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,820
Firstly, be obedient to the group leader and follow his/her instructions and

67
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,380
empty the contents inside the drums without thinking

68
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,240
The contents of the drums to group leader, the facts

69
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,140
Second, confirm what is inside the drums with the group leader.

70
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,940
Follow instructions accordingly if there are no issues.

71
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,700
Third, follow the boss' instructions, while confirming facts later.

72
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Fourth, explain about environmental pollution

73
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,540
After having explained to the boss, about the contents of the drums

74
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,720
follow instructions if there is no problem but

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,520
If there is likely to be a problem

76
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,420
try to convince the boss to reconsider.

77
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,540
If the group leader does not respond to counter argument, refuse to follow the instruction.

78
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,600
Consult with colleagues if you are given the cold shoulder.

79
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,360
I think this can be an option as well.

80
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:58,560
I agree. Alternatively, say you cannot do it due to injury or run away, for example.

81
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:06,900
If it necessary, there are usually a number of things and alternatives to consider given a particular situation.

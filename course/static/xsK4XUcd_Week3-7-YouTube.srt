1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
Value and Ethical Codes
for Engineers

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
The 7 Steps guide is a
general guideline

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
for ethical decision-making.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
It is not only for
engineers, but also

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
for broader range of people
in various occupations.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
However, as we have discussed
in previous lesson,

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
there's a special requirement
for engineering ethics:

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
engineers must
recognize new values

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
created by innovative
technologies and

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
balance it with
existing values.

11
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
Now, what are the
values that

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
engineers should
consider particularly?

13
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
There are ethics
tests designed

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
especially for professions.

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
They examine the
adequacy of an action

16
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
an engineer is
about to take,

17
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
in light of the
ethical values

18
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
that are particularly important
for engineering profession.

19
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
Strictly speaking, what
ethical values engineers

20
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
should put particular
emphasis should be discussed

21
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
not only by engineers but also
with all the stakeholders

22
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
including end-users
who benefit

23
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
from the technological
development.

24
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
Unfortunately,
there is no such a

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
discussion platform
at this moment.

26
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
Instead, the ethical
codes propounded

27
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
by the scientific societies

28
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
and associations
play that part.

29
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
In Europe and especially in
the United States,

30
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
engineers' ethical values
are often explained

31
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
by the social
contract model.

32
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
The social contract model is

33
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
closely related to the
European university system

34
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
established in the
12th century

35
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
and based on the notion of

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
'learned profession'.

37
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
Traditionally, European
societies acknowledged

38
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
and fostered the
'learned profession'

39
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,002
with highly professional
knowledge and

40
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
skills such as priests,
medical doctors,

41
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
and lawyers.

42
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,017
Like these traditional
professions, engineers tried

43
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
to build and maintain a
relationship of trust

44
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,023
with society so that
they would achieve

45
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,026
higher social recognition.

46
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
To be acknowledged as
profession,

47
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
the group needs to state

48
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,038
a mission statement to
the society.

49
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,041
So, like the Hippocratic
Oath for the physicians,

50
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,044
associations of engineers
compounded an oath

51
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,980
to state to what kinds of
values they serve.

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
Having and observing an
ethical code was a basic need

53
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,986
to be respected as
profession in a society.

54
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,995
So, engineers considered
what they should write

55
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,998
in the engineer's
ethical code.

56
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,004
There are many opinions
about ethical codes.

57
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
Indeed, philosopher John Radd
was skeptical of ethical codes.

58
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,019
Radd pointed out that
'ethic' is a notion

59
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,022
that evades universal
definition.

60
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,025
It is an open-ended concept

61
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,028
that has no one-and-only
definition.

62
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,031
Therefore, it is the
confusion of 'mathematical'

63
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,034
and 'ethical' solution to
find an answer

64
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,037
based on the ethical codes.

65
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,976
This oversimplifies the
observance of ethical codes

66
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,979
to achievement of moral
discipline.

67
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,991
Others consider the
ethical codes

68
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,994
not as rules but
rather as a guideline

69
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,997
that leads engineers
to make decisions.

70
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000
The ethical codes are the
embodiment of knowledge

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,003
and experiences accumulated
by preceding engineers.

72
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,015
It serves as a proper
guideline for current

73
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,018
and prospective engineers
at their duties

74
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,021
on their decision-making
process.

75
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,030
The ethical codes play a
significant role

76
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,966
in that they encourage awareness
of the responsibilities

77
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,969
of engineering and
normalization

78
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,972
of engineer's ethical
conducts.

79
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,984
Other scholars, including
Michael Davis,

80
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
place put a far more greater
emphasis on ethical codes.

81
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,993
According to Davis, the
ethical codes should be

82
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,996
regarded as contract
between professions.

83
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,002
An ethical code is a
social contract

84
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,005
between profession
and society.

85
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,011
In consideration for
their fulfillment

86
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,014
of specialized services that
are essential for the health,

87
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,017
safety and well-being of
people and its society,

88
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,020
which cannot be performed by
other individuals,

89
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,023
the society gives high
reputations towards engineers

90
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,960
and grant substantial
autonomy to the profession.

91
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,972
To maintain this mutually
beneficial relationship,

92
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,975
profession needs to construct
a strict ethical code.

93
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,981
At the same time, ethical
codes are contract

94
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,984
between the professional
engineers,

95
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,987
which foster and enable
mutual cooperation

96
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,990
between professionals.

97
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,996
This mutual cooperation
between the professionals

98
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,999
makes it possible for them
to oppose bigger pressures

99
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,002
that you cannot
resist alone.

100
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:48,008
Ethical codes protect
individual engineers

101
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,011
from an undesired
pressure, for instance,

102
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,014
to force them to skip
some working procedure

103
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,017
to save financial costs.

104
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,956


105
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,959
Ethical code gives a
foundation for engineers

106
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,962
to protest against such
pressures

107
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,965
not only as moral
practitioners but also

108
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,968
as professionals with skills
and knowledge.

109
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,971
As a contract between
professionals,

110
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,974
composition of ethical code
is an embodiment

111
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,977
of the common ideals shared
by the members of profession,

112
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,980
or the oath they
swear each other.

113
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,986
The establishment and
observance of ethical codes are

114
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,989
autonomous behavior of
professionals.

115
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,995
While the understanding of
ethical code

116
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,998
as a social contract
emphasizes

117
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,001
the engineer's powerful
influence on the society,

118
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,004
ethical code as a contract
between professions stresses

119
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,007
the internal norm and standard
of the profession of engineers.

120
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,946
One focuses on the
external factors

121
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,949
and the other looks at
internal factors.

122
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,952
These two interpretations of
ethical codes are

123
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,955
not mutually exclusive,

124
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,958
rather complementary
to each other.

125
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,961
As we have seen, in short,

126
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,964
ethical codes have
different functions.

127
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,967
Let's have a brief look on

128
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,970
how engineering
associations' ethical codes

129
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,973
have been constructed.

130
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,976
In the United States, the first
ethical codes of engineering

131
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,979
was propounded in the 1910s
with a model

132
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,982
of ethical codes established
by physicians in 1847.

133
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,994
The American Institute of
Electrical Engineers

134
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,997
made the first engineering
codes of ethics in 1912.

135
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,000
The early codes of ethics
aimed at

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,003
achieving a high social status
approved to physicians.

137
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,942
Therefore, engineers were

138
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,945
treated as individual
professionals

139
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,948
who serve their clients
independently,

140
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,951
rather than as a mere
member of organization.

141
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,957
These early codes emphasized

142
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,960
professional ethics
of engineers

143
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,963
and stipulated values such
as allegiance, obedience,

144
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,966
and the professional skills.

145
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,969
After the WWII,
scientific societies

146
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,972
and associations revised
their ethical codes

147
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,975
of engineers for
several times.

148
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,978
In addition to engineer's
responsibility

149
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,981
for employers and clients,
their responsibility

150
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,984
for public began to be
recognized.

151
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,987
After a half an century,

152
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,990
the engineer's mission
for the public was

153
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,993
stipulated in the
ethical codes.

154
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,996
Furthermore, in 1974,

155
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,999
a union of scientific
associations

156
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,002
established the ethical
codes that gives priority

157
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,005
to the the engineer's
responsibility for public

158
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,008
over their responsibility

159
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,011
towards employers
and clients.

160
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,017
This code of ethics
for engineers

161
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,020
established by the National
Society of Professional
Engineers

162
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,023
was adopted by many other
societies and associations,

163
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,026
becoming a standard model
of such codes.

164
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,038
Next, we will examine
important values

165
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,041
stated in these code of
ethics for engineers.

00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,009
Engineer's Ethics (2)

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
To which social groups

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
do engineers belong to?

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
First, engineers belong to

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
an organization; a
corporation or

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
an enterprise in
most cases.

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
This social group has its

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
ethical principles or
standards of conduct.

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
They parade a motto

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
to the society,

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
showing how they
act and behave.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
Second, engineers also

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
belong to professions,

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
including academic
societies and

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
professional associations.

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
The profession has

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
its own ethical principles,

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
which explain

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
how its members should

20
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
act to the society.

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
And finally,
engineers belong to

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
the society in a
broader context.

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
Therefore,

24
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
engineers belong to several
social groups,

25
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
which can be divided into
six layers, and

26
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
each social group has

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
its own specific
standards of conducts

28
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
that should be considered.

29
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
It ranges from the values

30
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
and standards of an
individual to

31
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
that of a constituent member

32
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
of the entire humankind.

33
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
In this course,

34
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
we should pay
particular attention

35
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
to the third point:

36
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
value and standards
of conduct

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
as a member of an
occupational group.

38
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
Usually this is

39
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
directly related

40
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
to business ethics and

41
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
corporate social
responsibility.

42
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,002
And the fourth point,

43
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
value and standards
of conduct

44
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
as a member of a group with
professional skills,

45
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,011
is the engineer's ethics.

46
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,014
So far we have discussed the
notion of 'ethics'.

47
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,017
Next, we will consider the
other term of

48
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
the 'engineer's ethics',
namely the 'engineering',

49
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,023
because an engineer is the one
who practice the technology.

50
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,026
What is 'engineering'?

51
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,029
There are many definitions
of 'engineer'.

52
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
An American Encyclopedia

53
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
defines 'engineer' as a
profession.

54
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:59,980
{The definition in the
encyclopedia shown in English on
the slide}

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
Traditional
profession includes

56
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,986
medical doctors and lawyers.

57
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,989
Engineers are also regarded
to be

58
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,992
highly intellectual,
professional occupation.

59
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,995
What kind of
professional occupation

60
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,998
is engineer?

61
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,001
Engineering is the
profession

62
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,004
that applies the knowledge
of natural sciences and

63
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,007
various practices to
economically utilize

64
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,010
the materials and forces of
the nature for the benefit
of humankind.

65
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
This has to be done
with judgment.

66
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,016
As doctors make
decision about

67
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,019
what kinds of treatment

68
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,022
should be applied to
a patient,

69
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,025
engineers judge

70
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,028
how the natural forces

71
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,031
should be applied for the
benefit of humankind.

72
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,976
Engineers practically
involve themselves

73
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,979
in this process of judgment
and application.

74
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,982
Here arises a big problem.

75
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,985
Even when we accept

76
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
this definition I just
explained,

77
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,991
it still remains undefined

78
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,994
what is the benefit of
mankind.

79
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,997
Many people say that

80
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000
engineering is neutral,

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,003
value free.

82
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,009
For instance, they say that

83
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,012
the production of a well-cut
knife is

84
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,015
value free.

85
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,018
But the act of

86
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,021
injure with the knife is

87
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,024
a bad conduct.

88
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
While, a creation of
artistic sculpture with the
same knife

89
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,030
is considered to be a good
conduct.

90
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,966
The act of using the knife
can be right or wrong,

91
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,969
but the production of the
knife itself is value free.

92
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,972
This is a popular idea about
engineering.

93
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,975
But, I disagree with this
claim

94
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,978
as it seems not effective
today any more.

95
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,981
Indeed, as the history has
seen,

96
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,984
science technology has
produced a great impact on
humankind.

97
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
So, the question of value
arises

98
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,990
already when you decide
which technology you would
employ.

99
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,993
Engineering and values are

100
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,996
rather inseparable from each
other.

101
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,999
What kind of technology

102
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,002
would you face with?

103
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,005
Which technology would you
use?

104
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,008
These decisions reflect the
value of

105
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,011
an individual, corporation
or organization.

106
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,014
Combining the definitions of
the two terms,

107
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,017
'engineering' and 'ethics',

108
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,020
I define 'engineering's
ethics' as follows:

109
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,023
"Engineering's ethics is a
body of normative system

110
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,960
in a social group that
engineers should follow

111
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,963
when they form a judgment on
their conduct

112
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,966
and on related values of
applying their knowledge of

113
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,969
the mathematical and natural
sciences

114
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,972
gained by study, experience,

115
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,975
and practice,

116
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,978
in order to economically
utilize

117
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,981
the materials and forces of

118
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,984
the nature for the benefit
of mankind."

119
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:48,008
How does the 'engineer's
ethics'

120
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,011
differ from that of general
public?

121
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,014
In this respect,

122
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,017
it is important to notice
that

123
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,953
technology produces a new
value.

124
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,956
Let me give an example.
Fifty or sixty years ago,

125
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,959
if you say you are
interested in

126
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,962
somebody else's internal
organs,

127
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,965
people would say you are
crazy.

128
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,968
However, in the contemporary
society

129
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,971
where we have
immunosuppressive drugs and

130
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,974
organ transplantation
technologies,

131
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,977
somebody else's organs that
used to be valueless

132
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,980
can be valuable for a
patient

133
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,983
suffering from liver
disease,

134
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,986
if the liver would be
compatible

135
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,989
to his/her body.

136
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,992
Thus,

137
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,995
technology gave a new value

138
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,998
to human body's organs.

139
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,001
Another example.

140
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,004
In 1932, James Chadwick

141
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,007
at the Cavendish Laboratory
of

142
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,010
the University of Cambridge

143
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,946
discovered the neutron.

144
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,949
Before his discovery,

145
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,952
an atom with a big nucleus

146
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,955
emitting natural radiation,
such as uranium,

147
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,958
had been regarded

148
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,961
worth a subject of
scientific study.

149
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,964
But no one recognized its
other potential values.

150
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,967
However, once Leo Szilard
and

151
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,970
his fellow physicists
discovered

152
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,973
the mechanism of neutron
chain reaction,

153
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,976
which occurs when one single
nuclear reaction causes

154
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,979
one or more subsequent
nuclear reactions,

155
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,982
scientists realized

156
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,985
they could apply

157
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,988
this mechanism of releasing

158
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,991
vast quantities of energy

159
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,994
using neutrons to other
purposes,

160
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,997
such as nuclear weapons.

161
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,942
Therefore,

162
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,945
science and technology
produce

163
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,948
a new value,

164
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,951
and only engineers

165
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,954
working in the forefront

166
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,957
can recognize the emergence
of

167
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,960
this new value.

168
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,963
And it is only engineers

169
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,966
who can design appropriate
acts

170
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,969
and conducts how to use the
innovative technology,

171
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,972
carefully balancing between

172
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,975
the new and existing values.

173
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,978
In this regard, engineer's
ethics has

174
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:39,979
a particular responsibility.

00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:16,384
As we have discussed before in this course, in ethics,


2
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:21,097
there is precautionary ethics, 
which focuses on what you shouldn’t do,


3
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:25,439
and intentional ethics, which is about 
considering what you should do


4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,011
and acting accordingly. The discourse and teaching

5
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:34,472
of engineering ethics have so far tended to 

6
00:00:34,472 --> 00:00:37,746
emphasize the precautionary side, but going forward, 

7
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:42,641
I have explained that we also need intentional ethics.

8
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:45,285
The story of the Honda Civic is a perfect example 


9
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:49,143
of the positive results that decision-making


10
00:00:49,143 --> 00:00:52,787
and behavior based on intentional ethics can have.


11
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:56,512
Exactly. So, Mr. Kōno often says that


12
00:00:56,512 --> 00:01:02,260
engineers bear a special responsibility


13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:09,023
but have you ever thought about the reason why?

14
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:13,836
In past lectures, we have talked about how

15
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:16,054
technology demands responsibility


16
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:19,429
because of the great influence it exerts


17
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:22,285
on modern society.

18
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:25,144
I’d like you to take a look at this next slide.

19
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:28,470
I have been researching and teaching

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,377
engineering ethics for over 20 years now,

21
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:36,621
and up until maybe the last 5 or 6 years or so,

22
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:41,872
I’ve used these three models to explain

23
00:01:41,872 --> 00:01:46,871
why engineers have a special responsibility.

24
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:49,749
The first is the “Contract between 

25
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:52,921
Profession and Company” model,

26
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:56,465
also called the social contract model.

27
00:01:56,465 --> 00:02:02,531
The second is the “Social Experiment” model,

28
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:03,820
which says that technology changes society,

29
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,232
so in a sense, it’s an experiment.

30
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:09,234
And the third, which I have discussed

31
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:11,227
in various forms, is something called

32
00:02:11,227 --> 00:02:14,772
the “mutual dependence” model.

33
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:18,620
They are written about in more detail


34
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,080
on the course website, which I’d

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,062
like you to read.

36
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:26,090
I believe these models are each

37
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,400
quite persuasive models.

1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
Ethics of science and
technology

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,009
When scientists needs to
make ethical decision

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,012
Let me

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
first give you an overview

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
and goals of this

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
study program. Science and
technology

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
produce new values

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
and give great impact on
society and its environment.

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
Especially in Japan,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
the Great East Japan
earthquake induced

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
people to recognize both
positive

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
and negative aspect

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
of technology.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
As active practitioner of
technology,

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
scientists and engineers
take

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
distinctive responsibility
for the society.

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
In this course, we examine
the ethics

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
that is essential for
engineers of our time

19
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
to fulfill their duties.

20
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
Various potential ethical
problems

21
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
that engineers may face

22
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
will be explained through
specific examples,

23
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
in order to discuss how we
can

24
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
analyze and ethically
examine

25
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
these problems. Special
emphasis

26
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
will be placed on several
values,

27
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
such as safety, that
engineers

28
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
should consider highly
important.

29
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
Additionally,

30
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
based on these studies,

31
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
we will consider what kinds
of

32
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
ethical capacities and
abilities

33
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
are required for engineers

34
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
in the 21st century.

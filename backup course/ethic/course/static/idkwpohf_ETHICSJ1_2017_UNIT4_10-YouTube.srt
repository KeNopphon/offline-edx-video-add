1
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:15,306
Even more, in buisiness field.

2
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,760
Positive psychology is used.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,892
Called Zappos, on the internet, originally

4
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:25,309
there is a company which sells shoes

5
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,752
,it has developed like skyscraper.

6
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:33,772、
The CEO of the company, Tony Jay

7
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:38,630
runs the company using positive psychology

8
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,421
and it leads the company's sccess clearly.

9
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:44,605
Let's see Google

10
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:49,602
Google has Google University in their company for employees' training

11
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:54,215
In the system,

12
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:58,102
the most popular subject is

13
00:00:58,102 --> 00:01:00,370
the program, called Search Inside Yourself

14
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,891
Eh,

15
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,092
This is also 

16
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:07,735
based on positive psychology.

17
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:12,281
Moreover, local government also tries to use  

18
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,578
positive psychology,

19
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:17,861
I heard. 

20
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,365
In Australia,

21
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,768、
you know the state of south Australia,

22
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:25,100
of which Adelede is the capita.l

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,290
Then The state of South Australia ,

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,770
Dr. Seligman visited there, and 

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,802
the problem the state has, actually industrial structure 

26
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:37,184
is changing slowly

27
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:39,950
To solve the problem,

28
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,736
I asked him 

29
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:43,617
what I can do.

30
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:48,431
Then he proposed

31
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:54,086
to make strategies to increase well-being in entire state,

32
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:57,362
the government should lead those strategies.

33
00:01:57,362 --> 00:02:00,423
That what he said to me, and I proposed his idea to the government.

34
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:04,825
Then, the state of south Australia 

35
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:08,767
made a lab tomeasuring well-being and resilience,

36
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:12,975
they actually measured well being

37
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:16,721
and decided to take in positive education,

38
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,405
which is based on positive psychology,

39
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:23,832
they launched some actual strategies to increase well-being in entire of the state.

40
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:29,546
This is a report made by 

41
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:32,779
officials in Great Britain,

42
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:38,019
including various good practices 

43
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:41,262
about training of mindfulness.

44
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:45,728
The report says with these good practices supported by science

45
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:49,103
they try to increase well-being 

46
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:52,704
in Great Britain.

47
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:57,248
In addition, the United Nations set World Happy Day 

48
00:02:57,248 --> 00:03:00,767
on March 20, in 2011.

49
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:05,378
After 2011, almost every year,

50
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:12,011
countries participating in the United Nation measure their well-being

51
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:18,358
and apply the data to their strategy making.

52
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:21,513
That's what the report meant.

53
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:24,010
This is the latest investigation, 

54
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,576
the data of well-being from 2013 to 2015 is on it, though,

55
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:34,325
Sadly, Japan is on 53th (laughing).

56
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:40,064
Achievement of the study about positive psychology is  

57
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:42,432
used for various purpose.

58
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,333
I think that is true. However,

59
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,798
Are there any theory about well-being or hapiness

60
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:51,141、
already?

61
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:54,382
Are there any theory systems?

62
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:58,805
As I told you,

63
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,091
The study about well-being started 

64
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:06,468
just 10 years ago.

65
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:12,911
Therefore, there have not been theories and models, 

66
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:18,209
like anyone can accept.

67
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,443
Mr. Kono, sorry for asking suddenly, 

68
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:23,271
I heard you studied the history of science as well.

69
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:27,583
Do you know what Aristotle believed 

70
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,938
cosmo was made by?

71
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:33,057
Or,where Aristle believed  the center of cosmo.

72
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:37,354
Do you remember that.

73
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:40,820
Aristle devided ceiling into ground, 

74
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,286
he said ground is made by soil, water, air, and fire,

75
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:48,699
so called the classical element theory,

76
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,386
and he thought the center of cosmo is the Earth. 

77
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:57,485
Exactly, that's right. And his thought

78
00:04:57,485 --> 00:05:00,301
is told in Greece and Rome

79
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,242
even after Alistle passed,

80
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:05,758
when the first University in Europe appeared,

81
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:09,266
his thought was told to people to people.

82
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:13,426
But, in 16th or 17th century, when Gallireo and Newton

83
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,655
made contemporaly science,

84
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:24,119
people started thinking about cosmo for the first time after Aristle.

85
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:27,018
That means people finally started studying cosmo

86
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:30,813
scientifically. After 400 or 500 years passed,

87
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:33,475
finally we are getting closer to the answer of birth of cosmo

88
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:38,166
and its structure. Using these knowledge,

89
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:42,155
we are now able to utilize science 

90
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:44,692
for various purposes thanks to Aristle.

91
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:48,872
However, well-being Aristle believed the most important 

92
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:53,116
and biggest problem

93
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:56,608
has never been tackled scientifically

94
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:59,631
at all.

95
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:01,916
So people is 

96
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:05,620
still studying various models and theory

97
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,861
about well being.

Seven-Step Guide 3

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
In the previous step,
we learned

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
how to examine listed
possible actions.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
In this examination,

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
we use several 'tests'.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
These tests are called

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
'ethic tests'.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
It is to consider validity

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
and propriety of
certain actions.

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
This tests also reveals

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
ethically
inappropriate actions.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
First, let me explain about

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
the Reversibility Test.

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
In the reversibility test,
you will consider

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
if you would make the
same decision,

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
even if you were in
the position

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
who would be
directly affected

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
by the action you are
about to take.

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
For example,

20
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
if the result of your action

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
you are taking will give
negative influence

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
on your health and safety,

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
you may not to make
such an decision.

24
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
If so, the action is

25
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
ethically not appropriate.

26
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
It is same as the
golden rule that

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
you should not do something

28
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
you don't want to be done.

29
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
Reversibility Test is thus also
called as the Golden Rule Test.

30
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
The golden rule is a basic
moral principle

31
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
shared by major
religions in the world.

32
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
In Christianity, it
is said that

33
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
'one should treat others as

34
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
one would like others
to treat oneself.'

35
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
In Confucianism, they say
'one should not treat others

36
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
in ways that one would not
like to be treated.'

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
Besides Reversibility Test,

38
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
can we do some
additional tests?

39
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
Yes. In the following part,

40
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
I will explain a few
more ethical tests.

41
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
Let's look at the
'Universalization Test'.

42
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
The Universalization
Test is based on

43
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
Immanuel Kant's ethical
theory of duty.

44
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,011
In his famous
deontological ethics,

45
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,014
Kant argued that
ethical thinking

46
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,017
fundamentally seeks
for universality,

47
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
and the primary formal
requirements

48
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,023
for ethics is to be
universal.

49
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,026
Therefore, ethical
value of an act

50
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,029
can be measured by

51
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
its universalizability,

52
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
if you can universalize
it or not.

53
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,980
Based on this
Kantian ethics,

54
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
the Universalization
Test considers:

55
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,986
what if 'everybody'
took the action

56
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,989
that you are about
to conduct?

57
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,995
In other words, you
universalize the action.

58
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,998
If, as a consequence of

59
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,001
the action taken by
everybody,

60
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,004
contradictions and
inconsistency

61
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,007
may occur within
the society,

62
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,010
then the action is
ethically inappropriate.

63
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
Let's take an example of

64
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,016
lying or breaking promise.

65
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,019
Let's test the case if you
decide, for some reason,

66
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,022
to break your promise
with friend.

67
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,025
What if everybody
would break promises?

68
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,028
Then, the society
does not function.

69
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,031
Thus, breaking promises is

70
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,034
an ethically
inappropriate behavior.

71
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,037
Universalization Test is

72
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,973
a useful way of judging

73
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,976
appropriateness of action.

74
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,979
Another useful measure is.

75
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,982
the Virtue Test. It is
less well-known

76
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,985
but quite important.

77
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
The Virtue Test is based on

78
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,991
the virtue ethics
originated by

79
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,994
ancient Greek philosophers
such as Aristotle.

80
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,997
Virtue ethics examine
not an action

81
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000
in a certain situation

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,003
but the actor itself.

83
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,006
You think if the action
you are taking is

84
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,009
appropriate to a person

85
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,012
you want to be liked.

86
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,015
You also examine,

87
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,018
whether the action leads you

88
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,021
to live a good
life you wish.

89
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
In Aristotle's ethics,.

90
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,030
the 'good life' means

91
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,966
the highest human good, or

92
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,969
'eudaemonia'.

93
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,972
The Greek word
'eudaemonia' is

94
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,975
often translated as
'happiness',

95
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,978
but it is better said as

96
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,981
'well-being'.

97
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,984
In business ethics,

98
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
the Virtue Test is called
as 'mirror test'.

99
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,990
You think yourself,

100
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,993
how you feel when
you look at

101
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,996
your face in the mirror

102
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,999
the next morning after

103
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,002
you have conducted a
certain action.

1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,951
The topic I'd like to introduce now is

2
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:18,690
thinking about the ethics of science and engineering

3
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,770
on four different levels.

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,810
I have spoken on the subject of ethics of science and engineering

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,029
to a number of people.

6
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,650
I've discussed it extensively.

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,859
It's a subject that really gets people talking.

8
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,400
I've had many interesting discussions and

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,510
participants presented a variety of opinions

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,100
but it would often get to the point when

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,410
I felt there was a mismatch in our perspectives.

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,579
This made me think about

13
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,180
the four different levels concerning ethics.

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,899
When people discuss ethics, each speaking on a different level

15
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,230
they will only be at cross purposes.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,309
This is the conclusion I've come to.

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,540
First, we have engineers

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,420
or scientists. We focus on individuals.

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,020
Why did this or that person make a particular decision?

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,060
Think from their point of view.

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,920
Was the decision they made right?

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,330
This is what we call

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,640
micro-ethics.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,080
Looking at ethics from the point of view of

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,490
the relationship between science and society

26
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,250
when making decisions

27
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,530
is referred to as macro-ethics.

28
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,939
So we have micro-ethics

29
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:37,240
with an individual focus

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,360
and macro-ethics where we look at

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,079
the bigger picture and role of science in the society.

32
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,430
These are two major levels.

33
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:55,430
But, especially in Japan...

34
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,250
Apart from micro- and macro- ethics

35
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,790
there is an additional, organisational level.

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,380
This applies to engineers in particular.

37
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,649
It's very common to be part of an organisation.

38
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,780
So we have this meso-ethics level in between micro and macro.

39
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,480
I think it's easy to think about it in this way.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,570
But there is yet another level.

41
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,790
It's rarely brought up.

42
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,530
On the fourth level, we look at the nature of science itself.

43
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,500
And what technology is.

44
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,100
What purpose do they serve?

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,560
On this level we ask more

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,380
metaphysical questions.

47
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,750
This I call meta-level ethics.

48
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,980
So we have meta-, macro-, mezo- and micro-ethics.

49
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,010
When you are aware of these four levels

50
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,199
and think about ethics within this framework

51
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,820
you start realising, oh he's talking on the micro-ethics level.

52
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,600
And now I'm talking about macro-ethics.

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,440
It becomes easier for you to engage in a discussion

54
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,230
on the same plane.

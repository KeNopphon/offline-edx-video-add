1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
Engineers' ethics (1)

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,012
It is not easy to define

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
what is engineers' ethics,

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
because 'engineer's ethics',
engineers', and 'ethics',

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
each of these
three terms has

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
many different meanings.

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
To approach how we can
define 'engineer's ethics',

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
we will first look at a
couple of basic definitions.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
Let's start with the
term 'ethics'.

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
A world authority
in this field,

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
Michael Davis,

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
claims that 'ethics',
in general,

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
can be defined

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
by three meanings:

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
First, 'ethics', as its
origin derives from

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
the Greek word 'ethos',

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
or 'customs and usage',

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
'ethics' is defined as

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
customs and usages

20
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
in a certain geographical

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
or cultural area. Second,

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
'ethics' means a
body of codes

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
of behavior in a
social group.

24
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
In this course, we pay

25
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
particular attention on this

26
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
second definition. Thirdly,

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
'ethics' is a discipline

28
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
that scholarly describes and

29
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
interprets the codes

30
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
of behavior

31
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
in a social group.

32
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
In addition to

33
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
this definition of 'ethics'

34
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
by Michael Davis,
there are many

35
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
other definitions of
the term.

36
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
The shortest definition

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
I have found is that

38
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
by Oliver A. Johnson.
Johnson defined

39
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
'ethics' as 'the
science of conduct.'

40
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
Indeed, 'the science
of conduct'

41
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
is a huge subject that
has been discussed

42
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,002
by numerous scholars since
the time of ancient Greek.

43
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
Looking back the history

44
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
of the studies on ethics,

45
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,011
scholars have considered

46
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,014
mainly two questions:

47
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,017
One is"what is
good, or bad?",

48
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
and the other is

49
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,023
"what is right or wrong?"

50
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,026
These two problems were

51
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,029
examined by ethics as
scholarly practice.

52
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
However,

53
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
no one has ever succeeded

54
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,038
in propounding the one
and only definition

55
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,041
that can be
universally agreed.

56
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,044
Still,

57
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,980
we know that there
are at least

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
three different approaches

59
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,986
to answer the question:

60
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,989
Firstly, there's
the 'Virtue Ethics'

61
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,992
represented by Aristotle.

62
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,995
Secondly, the 'Dentology',

63
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,998
represented by
Immanuel Kant,

64
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,001
focuses on the
conduct itself.

65
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,004
Thirdly, the
'Utilitarian Ethics',

66
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,007
whose slogan 'the greatest
happiness of the greatest
number'

67
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,010
you may also have
heard of once,

68
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
aims at the results
of conduct,

69
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,016
thus called as
utilitarianism.

70
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,019
So, these are

71
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,022
the three basic viewpoints
on the ethics in the West.

72
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,025
Now, how do we define
ethics in Japan?

73
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,028
Let's look at a Japanese
dictionary definition.

74
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,031
It defines ethics as

75
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,034
'the path of human
ethics (Jin-rin), or

76
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,037
the normative principle of
practical morality.

77
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,973
But what is 'Jin-rin', or

78
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,976
'the path of human ethics'?

79
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,979
The dictionary defines
'Jin-rin' as

80
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,982
'the public order and
discipline

81
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,985
among people, or the path

82
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
you should follow as
a human.'

83
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,991
This sound still too vague

84
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,994
like a puzzling Zen riddles.

85
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,997
So, let us think about

86
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000
that 'ethics' is a
synonym for 'morality'.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,003
In the dictionary,
'morality' is defined as

88
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,006
'the path that people
should take',

89
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,009
and further it defines
morality

90
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,012
and ethics are 'the body of

91
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,015
norms that is generally
recognized

92
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,018
by a social group and its
members

93
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,021
as criteria for
judging a person

94
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,024
or his/her conducts
to other members

95
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
whether the person or
conducts are

96
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,030
good or bad to the society.'

97
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,966
Sounds a little more
understandable.

98
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,969
As we have seen,
there are many

99
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,972
other different definitions

100
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,975
of the term 'ethics'.

101
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,978
In this course,
rather than borrowing

102
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,981
somebody else's definitions,

103
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,984
I will use my own
definition.

104
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
I define 'ethics' as
follows:

105
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,990
'Ethics is a whole body of

106
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,993
normative system that
functions as criteria

107
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,996
in a social group for
judging value

108
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,999
of conducts, between
good and evil, or

109
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,002
right and wrong.' It also

110
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,005
means 'intellectual
practices

111
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,007
of continuous examination on
the system.'

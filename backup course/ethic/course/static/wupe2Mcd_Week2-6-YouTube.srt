00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
How to act as engineer on
the site ? (1)

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,012
The following part

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
of this lecture will be left

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
to Mr. Kono.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
The interview we had

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
with Mr. Boisjoly in 2003

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
will give an account of

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:33,033
his action at the accident.

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
The interview is

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
also available in text

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
on our website.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
So, Mr. Kono,

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
please start.

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
Okay. We'll examine
the details of

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
the Challenger case
in four stages,

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
from January 1985
to the accident.

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
What kind of action
would you take,

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
if you were Mr. Mr. Boisjoly?

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
Stage A: In January 1985, in
the post-flight investigation

20
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
of the Discovery, an engineer
of the Morton-Thiokol

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
Mr. Mr. Boisjoly, found out
the evidence

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
that the burning gas blew

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
by the primary O-ring.
What would you do?

24
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
There are several
possible actions:

25
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
1) Examine the problem by
yourself more in detail,

26
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
without consulting
anyone else;

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
2) Consult your fellow
engineers;

28
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
3) Consult your
immediate boss;

29
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
4) Express your concern

30
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
directly to the chief
engineer executive,

31
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
or the vice-president of
the Morton-Thiokol

32
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
responsible for engineering;

33
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
5) Express your concern

34
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
directly to the
company's CEO;

35
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
6) Contact to the
consultation desk

36
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
at the Morton-Thiokol

37
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
or NASA (if any);

38
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
7) Form a private team
of professionals

39
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
in the company to
find a solution

40
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
before proposing it

41
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,002
to your boss;

42
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
8) Report the evidence to
an external organization;

43
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
9) Provide the information
to mass-media;

44
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,011
10) Do nothing special;

45
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,014
11) Take some other actions.

46
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
As you see, there are many

47
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,023
possible actions
you could take.

48
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,026
If you were Mr. Boisjoly,

49
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,029
what would you do, when,

50
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
one year before the
Challenger's disaster,

51
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
you found out the flaw

52
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,038
with the O-ring?

53
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,041
What is the value at stake
at this first stage?

54
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
Who are the stakeholders?

55
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,989
In Mr. Boisjoly's case,

56
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,992
upon finding the flaw,

57
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,995
he consulted his
immediate boss.

58
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,001
Recognized the problem
with field joint,

59
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,004
he observed the
low-temperature

60
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,007
at the Discovery's launch

61
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,010
and hypothesized that

62
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
the temperature may
affect O-rings sealing.

63
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,016
He then reported this to
his boss, inaudible.

64
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,022
The boss directed Mr. Boisjoly

65
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,025
to visit the Marshall
Space Flight Center

66
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,028
to report his hypothesis

67
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,031
to the members of NASA.

68
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,034
Despite Mr. Boisjoly's
report on the relation

69
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,037
between the temperature and
rubber's elasticity,

70
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,973
NASA, requested Mr. Boisjoly

71
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,976
not to stress his
observation,

72
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,979
claiming it wouldn't be cold

73
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,982
at the next launch

74
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,985
planned in Florida

75
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
in April following year.

76
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,991
Stage B: What kind of action
would you take,

77
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,994
if you would be
requested by NASA

78
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,997
not to stress your
observation?

79
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000
Let me list possible
options:

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,003
1) Accept NASA's assumption

81
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,006
and request.

82
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,009
As NASA is your
important client,

83
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,012
you won't tell your
observation

84
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,015
beyond your fellow
engineers;

85
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,018
2) Irrelevant to the air
temperature of the scheduled
day of launch,

86
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,021
it is an urgent
matter of safety.

87
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,024
You will write a report to
criticize the NASA's response

88
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
and hand it to your boss or
the vice-president

89
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,030
who is responsible for
engineering;

90
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,966
3) A launch under
low-temperature

91
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,969
seems less possible,

92
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,972
but this is still

93
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,975
a grave matter of safety.

94
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,978
You will accept the
NASA's request,

95
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,981
but ask your boss

96
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,984
to form a special team

97
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
to investigate the problem;

98
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,990
4) Form an investigation
team yourself

99
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,993
with your fellow
engineers and staff

100
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,996
in related fields including
administrators

101
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,999
and PR office, examine
possible effects

102
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,002
that can be caused
by an accident,

103
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,005
and propose a measure that

104
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,008
the corporation should take;

105
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,011
5) Contact the compliance
support desk

106
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,014
at Morton-Thiokol or
NASA, if there is any;

107
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,017
6) Report to an external
organization;

108
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,020
7) Take some other actions.

109
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,023
These are possible
actions you may take.

110
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,960
It should be noted here that

111
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,963
the appropriate action you
should take might differ,

112
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,966
depending on the
likelihood of an accident,

113
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,969
how it is threatening
and crucial.

114
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,972
For what happened to
Mr. Boisjoly next,

115
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,974
you should read his
interview report.

1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
Stakeholders in the
case of Challenger

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
Now, who were the
stakeholders

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
in the case of space
shuttle Challenger?

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
The stakeholders in
the case included

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
NASA, Morton-Thiokol.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
More precisely,

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
Larry Mulloy of NASA, and

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
engineers and managements
of the Morton-Thiokol,

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
namely Boisjoly,
Mason, and Lund,

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
as well as crew members of
Challenger including McAuliffe.

11
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
Furthermore, families
of crew members

12
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
and school children
of McAuliffe.

13
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
President Reagan,
the government

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
and related ministries
of United States

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
were also stakeholder.

16
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
The list goes on:

17
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
municipal government in
Utah, local residents,

18
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
employees and their families
of the Morton-Thiokol,

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
its subcontractors, and
other contractors of NASA

20
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
and their employees
and their families.

21
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
In a broader context,
engineers and

22
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
developers of the space
developments in other countries,

23
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
are also stakeholders.

24
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
Of course American citizen
were stakeholders, too.

25
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
Especially we should
note the end-users,

26
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
namely crewmembers were
weak stakeholders.

27
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
We should also note that

28
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
invisible stakeholders who were
not directly involved in the
explosion,

29
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
such as family members of
the crewmembers,

30
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
were actually weak stakeholders
affected by the incident quite
directly.

31
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
Furthermore, it was a
disaster

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
occurred to such a huge
project of

33
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
great expectations and hope,

34
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
and there were many
other stakeholders

35
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,002
affected by it at
different levels.

36
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
Despite of their
invisibility,

37
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
it is still possible that

38
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,011
the disaster influenced on

39
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,014
their life-choices.

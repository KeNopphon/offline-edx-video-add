00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,009
Space Shuttle Challenger
disaster (1) as a lesson of
engineer's ethics

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
In this lecture,

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
we will examine the case of

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
Space Shuttle Challenger
disaster,

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
which happened in

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
January 1986.

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
This is a highly significant
case

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
for the matter of engineer's
ethics,

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
and is discussed on

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
almost every textbooks.

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
As the accident was
witnessed

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
by people all over the whole
world,

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
it triggered people

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
to recognize the necessity
of

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
ethics of engineers and
corporations.

16
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
This is, indeed,

17
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
a classical case study of

18
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
engineer's ethics.

19
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
So let us examine the most
famous case.

20
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
I would like you to think

21
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
about this case,

22
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
not from a viewpoint of a
critic or

23
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
a non-participant observer,

24
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
but from a viewpoint of an
engineer,

25
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
who was responsible for

26
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
the decision-making process
of the project.

27
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
The engineers who took part

28
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
in this project and their
values

29
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
will be further discussed

30
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
in following lectures,

31
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
so please listen to the
discussion carefully,

32
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
and think about

33
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
who are the stakeholder

34
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
in this case,

35
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
to what kinds of values

36
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
these stakeholders place

37
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,001
greatest importance.

    "Think of what mankind has achieved", 
    "in the 20th century.", 
    "Here on this slide we have",

    "compiled by the United States National Academy of Engineering. So this is the list.", 
    "We, humans, have been alive for only one second in the Cosmic Calendar,",

    "This is something to think about.", 
    "On to the next slide...", 
    "This graph shows the changes in our population", 
    "and energy demand from the year 1800.", 
    "At the end of the 19th century there were 1.7 billion people.", 
    "As for the energy demand", 
    "it would be equivalent to", 
    " 500 million tons of oil per year.", 
    "However, only 100 years since then,", 
    "only 0.25 seconds", 
    " on the Cosmic Calendar scale,",

    "And now it is over 7 billion.", 
    "Our energy consumption in the year 2000", 
    "was about 9.2 billion tons of oil a year.", 
    "Within just a century,", 
    "less than a quarter second in the Cosmic Calendar,", 
    "our population quadrupled, and energy consumption increased 18 times.", 
    "That is quite rapid.", 
    "The per capita energy consumption", 
    "rose about 5 times.", 
    "The energy consumption", 
    "is not evenly distributed across the world.", 
    "It has not risen that much for people", 
    "in the developing countries that account for", 
    "the majority of the world's population.", 
    "This huge rise in energy consumption", 
    "is caused by the people of developed countries",

    " and European countries.", 
    "In the light of this,", 
    "it is easy to see why the Earth quickly became",

    "If developing countries continue to industrialize", 
    "and increase their energy consumption", 
    "just like the already developed countries had done,", 
    "we can easily imagine how disastrous", 
    "that might be.", 
    "Well, the Cosmic Calendar", 
    "illustrates the greatness of mankind", 
    "but it also puts our existence into perspective", 
    "by showing just how brief", 
    "our history on this planet is.",

    "the engineers and scientists who have to tackle ethical problems", 
    "and about the regulations they need to abide by.", 
    "These established rules", 
    "may seem set in stone", 
    "and impossible to change.", 
    "People think this is just how it is.", 
    "It is quite common", 
    "to think this way.", 
    "But looking at it from the broad perspective", 
    "there is nothing that definitely cannot be changed.", 
    "These issues are merely", 
    "a brief local phenomenon.", 
    "The bigger perspective lets us see that", 
    "anything can be changed if you set your mind to it.", 
    "It gives us courage", 
    "to act.", 
    "Well, then, what about the future?", 
    "Our future?", 
    "We're in the 21st century now.", 
    "In Cosmic Calendar terms the 21st century",

    "the relationship between science and society develop?", 
    "Or how, in what way", 
    "should we keep science and technology", 
    "under control?", 
    "I often use this picture", 
    "of a race car.", 
    "It is precisely because it's a time when humanity depends on technology", 
    "that engineers and scientists are expected to", 
    "make ethical decisions based on the macro point of view,", 
    "on a broad perspective.", 
    "And why is that the case?", 
    "Technology was born", 
    "only a second ago in the Cosmic Calendar.", 
    "Let me give you a metaphor.", 
    "At that time we, humans,", 
    "were like a driver", 
    "that just got a driver\u2019s license.", 
    "Having just stepped outside,", 
    "the brand new license in hand,", 
    "the freshly-minted driver comes across a race car.", 
    "This car is a metaphor for technology.", 
    "Normally, rookie drivers", 
    "do not get to drive race cars just like that.", 
    "It is quite scary to imagine what might happen if they did.", 
    "But our driver finds this race car with its engine on,", 
    "everything in gear, ready to go.", 
    "The tank is full of petrol.", 
    "The road ahead is unusually wide.", 
    "The driver tentatively steps on the accelerator.", 
    "The racing car, the technology,", 
    "starts and gains momentum.", 
    "Mankind sees technology as an amazing thing", 
    "and lets it pick up more and more speed.", 
    "Our racing car", 
    "keeps going faster and faster.", 
    "We entered the second half of the 20th century", 
    "going at high speed.", 
    "We can not see what the future might hold.", 
    "Checking the fuel tank,", 
    "looking at the fuel gauge,", 
    "we notice we're running out of gas.", 
    "We cannot see what's ahead.", 
    "Maybe the road", 
    "isn't straight.", 
    "Maybe we're approaching a corner.", 
    "Maybe it's a hairpin corner.", 
    "And maybe what lies ahead is a wall.", 
    "This is the situation we're in.", 
    "We have never before", 
    "tried to step on the brake", 
    "of the racing car that is technology.", 
    "Neither have we used the steering wheel.", 
    "We're just greenhorns", 
    "who have only been pushing down on the accelerator.", 
    "This is how we can describe our current situation.", 
    "This is the picture we get", 
    "when we look from the macro perspective,", 
    "from the perspective of time.", 
    "So how should the present-day", 
    "scientists and engineers act,", 
    "what guidelines should they use", 
    "to make decisions?", 
    "Sometimes thinking from such a big perspective,", 
    "from the macro perspective,", 
    "will let you see things more clearly,", 
    "and give you new ideas.", 
    "I see, that makes sense!"

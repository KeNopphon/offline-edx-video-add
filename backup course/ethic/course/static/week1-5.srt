1
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,900
The examples that I've talked about so far

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,880
focus on examples related to

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,810
science, technology, and society.

4
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,930
The fact that human relations are getting complicated

5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,730
is something you have probably realised as well.

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,809
In the history of mankind

7
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,949
modern science and technology's role in human society

8
00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:41,510
has never been more impactful than at any other era.

9
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,890
That's probably something we can say.

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,960
What we now call Science and Technology

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,790
are words that have clear definition but

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,729
behind Science and Technology, there are always humans that's how it is

13
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,839
There are either experts who are involved or organisations

14
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:57,980
involved

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,430
So these Science and Technology experts

16
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,750
they work within an organisation that makes decisions and

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,310
these actions and their consequences

18
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,159
can have serious impact on society and the environment.

19
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,860
We are in times when there are such a possibilities

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,200
this is something that we need to recognise

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,159
So in order to help you to understand this better,

22
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,409
some examples were raised.

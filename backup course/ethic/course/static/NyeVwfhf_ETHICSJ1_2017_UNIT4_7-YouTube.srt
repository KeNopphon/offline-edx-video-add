1
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,610
I am sorry , but can I ask you a question again.

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,770
Have you ever seen this picture.

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,600
Yes,

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,350
in the textbook.

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,590
I see.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,640
Actually I have never seen the actual work.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,390
This is the work of Rafaello 

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,850
who is epic artist in Renaissance


9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,000
it is in Batican.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,079
simplly,

11
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,140
I might simplificate it too much, though

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,140
People in Runaissance 

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,329
thought



14
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,190
wisdom of humankind came from 

15
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,420
ancient greece and Rome.

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,140
that was lost during middle ages.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,800
and people try to recover it

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,540
to bring it back to Europe

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,380
they try to bring back glorious wisdom

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,800
to Europe again.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,710
This is what they wanted 

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,860
to do.

23
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,661
An famouse artist Raffaelo 

24
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:22,930
made

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,750
he was also a philosophier 

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,060
who made new philosophy in Rome era

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,060
or in ancient Greece. 

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,440
For example, he wrote 

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,660
scientists

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,830
too in his pictures.



31
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,010
Pythagoras and

32
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,410
Archmedes

33
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:53,420
are drew in his pictures.

34
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,830
He also draw himselves 

35
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,700
in his picture

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,380
for people in Runaissance

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,770
they believe people in his picture 

38
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,740
made wisdom.




39
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,280
There are two people 

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,739
who found wisdom

41
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,720
These are the two

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,210
Do you know who they are

43
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,200
I remember one is Plato pointing out ceiling, and

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,880
Aristole pointing out ground,

45
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,250
Maybe.

46
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,680
Plato shows idea,

47
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,150
and points out ceiling where idea is.

48
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,420
He positions himself at naturalism.

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,100
On the other hand, Aristlo points out ground 

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,330
to tell us to see real.

51
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,330
So

52
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,380
an eldery in the left is Plato,

53
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,060
and the right one is Aristole 

54
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,450
who is the most superior disciple of Plato.

55
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,050
A book Plato has is 

56
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,830
about his late discussion.

57
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,400
that is, "Timaios" written

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,170
for nature world.




59
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,150
A book Aristole has is 

60
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,690
"Ethica"

61
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,700
sometimes called Ethics

62
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,410
or Ethic

63
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,360
It is about his ethics

64
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,920
actually he did not write the book by himself,

65
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,750
his disciples wrote it

66
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,470
In Japanese, it is named after his son's name,

67
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,220
that is, Nicomachum ethics.

68
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,080
Its theme is 

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,880
eudimonia in Greece

70
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,290
The focus is put on 

71
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,730
Eudimonia



72
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,230
Eudimonia is 

73
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,459
translated in various way.

74
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,000
for example, flourishing,

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,950
prosperity, or happiness.

76
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,660
But




77
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,000
The most appropriate translation is 

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,900
well-being I think.

79
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,959
For example, Aristole studied

80
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,000

physics, biology, astronomy,




81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,439
and economics, politics

82
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,949
Metaphysiscs, and poems,

83
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:37,409
he studied variety of field,

84
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:41,060
and his disciples left 



85
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,139
Aristole's thought in the book.

86
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,990
so, he is often regarded as

87
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,409
pioneer of various academic fields

88
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,409
today.




89
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:55,490
In 12th century,  Europe had the first university

90
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,360
and developed it


91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,059
what was taught there was scholatic philosophy,

92
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:02,629
which binded the philosophy of Aristole  

93
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:06,949
with Christ.

94
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:12,830
In this way, person who is symbolized as wisdom of western

95
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,440
that is, thought of Aristole, this is ethics

96
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,300
and well-being.

97
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,259
Aristole refers to  

98
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,559
his own thought in various way

99
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:33,249
An important thing is 

100
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,759
called superative goodness,

101
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,749
it is to think what means living better,

102
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:42,279
that is, it is well-being.

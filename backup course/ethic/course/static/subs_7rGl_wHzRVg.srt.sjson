    "Now, let us give a test", 
    "on the actions we have listed", 
    "in the mini-case.", 
    "Considering the limitation of time,", 
    "we will examine their ethical value", 
    "through the Reversibility test and", 
    "the Universalization test.", 
    "How do you evaluate the action", 
    "with the Reversibility test?", 
    "Well, if my grand parents are", 
    "working in farming downriver,", 
    "I doubt if I follow", 
    "the chief manager's instruction.", 
    "Or, you can imagine", 
    "if your parents are perhaps", 
    "living downstream.", 
    "Then, at least you cannot", 
    "blindly obey the instruction.", 
    "That's right. The reversibility test reveals", 
    "that the Action Plan 1, following", 
    "the chief's instruction and releasing the contents", 
    "to river, to be ethical inappropriate.", 
    "Now, how about with the Universalization test?", 
    "If all the engineers in the world would", 
    "only follow the instruction,", 
    "despite having concern on the harm", 
    "it does to the environment,", 
    "then what happens?", 
    "Engineers will lose people's trust,", 
    "and inconsistencies arise in the society.", 
    "Therefore, the act of", 
    "obeying the chief's instruction blindly,", 
    "is ethically denied also", 
    "by the universalization test.", 
    "Yes. As we have seen, in the Step 5,", 
    "you will examine ethical appropriateness of", 
    "your action through various tests.", 
    "I believe, just knowing the conceptual framework", 
    "of the six tests helps a lot for us", 
    "to design our behavior as engineer.", 
    "Indeed, the ethic tests are", 
    "introduced to corporate activities as a way", 
    "to encourage employee's ethical behaviors.", 
    "Corporations such as Lockheed Martin", 
    "and Texas Instruments have their", 
    "own ethics tests.", 
    "Here, I will briefly refer to", 
    "the ethics test of the Texas Instrument,", 
    "a corporation well known", 
    "for its good ethical practices.", 
    "The Texas Instrument's ethics quick test lists", 
    "the following questions:", 
    "'Does the action legal?',", 
    "'Does it comply", 
    "with the Texas Instruments' values?',", 
    "'If you do it,", 
    "will you feel bad?',", 
    "'How will it look in the newspaper?'", 
    "and 'If you know it's wrong,", 
    "don't do it!'", 
    "Beneath the quick test, it reads:", 
    "if you are uncertain about something,", 
    "consult it with your boss", 
    "or Ethics Contact", 
    "till you are fully convinced.", 
    "The ethical tests are printed on a card,", 
    "which every employee of Texas Instruments is", 
    "carrying at all times.", 
    "Yes, an employee of the company brings,", 
    "besides his/her employee ID card,", 
    "an ethic card.", 
    "On the front side you read the ethical code", 
    "of the company, and the quick test stands", 
    "on the back.", 
    "Now, in the Step 6, you will review", 
    "your measure based on steps 1 to 5.", 
    "You make a final choice based on", 
    "the former considerations on", 
    "possible actions you may take.", 
    "It is also possible", 
    "a completely different option comes", 
    "under consideration at this point.", 
    "When you make the final decision", 
    "at step 6, you might think you have done", 
    "through the whole process of decision-making.", 
    "However, the Seven step guide has", 
    "one more important step,", 
    "step 7.", 
    "In the step 7,", 
    "you consider how you could reduce", 
    "the likelihood that you will need", 
    "to make a similar decision again.", 
    "You should also think how you could solve", 
    "the problem of your situation", 
    "and improve your organization,", 
    "by re-examining", 
    "the former steps from 1 to 6.", 
    "What is the significance of the step 7?", 
    "One thing is, of course,", 
    "it is beneficial to think once again", 
    "if it is really good to take that action.", 
    "But more important than that,", 
    "it is significant to work out a plan", 
    "how you could avoid falling", 
    "in a similar situation.", 
    "Of course it is possible that", 
    "there would be nothing you could do.", 
    "But, there might be a way to change the organization", 
    "to prevent the problem. For instance,", 
    "improving the atmosphere at your workplace", 
    "to encourage employees", 
    "to consult difficult situations with others,", 
    "or providing better support from the ethics consultant,", 
    "this would change the whole situation.", 
    "It is thus an essential step to design measures", 
    "to prevent falling in a similar ethical problem.", 
    "Furthermore, re-examining your situation", 
    "not only from a micro", 
    "but from a macro point of view", 
    "leads you to consider in which way", 
    "the organizations or systems should change.", 
    "Referring to the 4 levels of engineering ethics", 
    "we have studied in the beginning of this class,", 
    "you can say that the step 7 is where", 
    "you move from the micro viewpoint", 
    "to the mezzo point of view.", 
    "In a real situation,", 
    "you might have not enough time", 
    "to follow the whole steps.", 
    "However, following the 7 Steps guide,", 
    "a longer, careful consideration is crucial,", 
    "especially for a prevailing problem", 
    "that may cause an enormous impact.", 
    "The guide is also helpful to look back", 
    "on actions you took.", 
    "Of course, the 7 Steps guide cannot", 
    "solve all the ethical problems.", 
    "It is just a guideline you can follow,", 
    "which enables you to carefully consider", 
    "before you come to a decision", 
    "how you act.", 
    "However, it is helpful", 
    "not to jump to an impulsive conclusion", 
    "but to think thoroughly,", 
    "even when you have to make", 
    "an ethical decision", 
    "in a complicated situation.", 
    "You can improve your ability", 
    "in ethical decision-making by examining", 
    "different previous cases according to the guideline", 
    "and by experiencing", 
    "the decision-making processes", 
    "by yourself.", 
    "I want you to think about,", 
    "what if you were in these cases,", 
    "how you could make your ethical decision."

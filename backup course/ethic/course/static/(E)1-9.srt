1
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,900
Learning from examples of past failed case studies

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,500
we can Leverage the lessons learnt

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,680
to test our own ethical judgment.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,100
Isn't that an important thing?

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,430
Yes, of course it is very important

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:30,680
If we say that until now, most cases are related to the
 education of ethics

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,960
based on the happenings in the past

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,840
There were various scandals

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,560
and incidents that happened

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,310
When we decide, let's not do this 
sort of thing

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,780
Let's decide not to do this sort of thing

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,280
There are many methods to emphasize

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,560
this in education

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:58,460
But then, in fact, it only looks at ethics from one point of view

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,370
that's what I believe is happening

16
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:06,560
As I mentioned at the beginning of today's lecture

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,110
things that must be done and things that must be protected

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,759
placing emphasis on these things

19
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:14,729
in order to ensure that incidents and

20
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,590
scandals do not happen.

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,090
This is what we normally

22
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,740
call preventive ethics.

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,149
This is certainly important.

24
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:32,289
This is certainly and surely required in ethics education

25
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:33,689
when we think about ethics.

26
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,430
This standpoint of preventive ethics is important.

27
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,140
Even in education, teaching preventive ethics

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,639
needs to be done properly.

29
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:46,079
Although this is certain

30
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,759
when considering the original meaning of ethics.

31
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,060
We come to the second half of this subject

32
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,319
let's discuss ethics more slowly

33
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,319
It is not about something that engineers must adhere to.

34
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,999
What can engineers do?

35
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:10,250
What is the good that can be done, 
when we think in this way

36
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,810
This refers to aspirational ethics.

37
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,240
Aspirational ethics

38
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,250
as we would call it.

39
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:22,760
This is also another important aspect of ethics.

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,440
Even though I started talking about it earlier

41
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,420
when we talk about why this is so.

42
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,170
The original meaning of ethics is

43
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,210
to live well and to do things that allow us to live well

44
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,910
What kind of decision should we make 
and how should we act?

45
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,130
Thinking in this way involves ethics

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:46,170
As I said before

47
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,700
preventive ethics emphasizes what should not be done.

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,580
For example, when we look at

49
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,110
the Code of Ethics from various educational bodies

50
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,430
according to certain statistics, for example in America

51
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,170
there is the

52
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,690
Professional Engineers Association.

53
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,400
The provisions of the code written in the Code of Ethics

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,960
80% of them are passive or prohibitions

55
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,690
these are the types of codes being used

56
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,670
that's what was reported.

57
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,120
But as I said earlier

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,810
when we return to the original meaning of ethics

59
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,980
it is about what we need to do in order to live well.

60
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,930
When we look at ethics from the viewpoint of 
such intentions,

61
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,890
it is not about what engineers cannot do

62
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,540
but what we should aim to develop

63
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,040
or what a company should seek as their goals.

64
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,900
What needs to be developed or

65
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,140
how engineers and corporations should behave

66
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,040
also how to make better decisions and practices

67
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,310
with active intentions.

68
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,200
The existence of such ethics then surfaces.

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,620
This kind of intellectual act

70
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,040
as I mentioned earlier,

71
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,210
I call it â€œaspirational ethics"

72
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,780
Although there is such a subject

73
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,940
Of course, we must work on Preventive Ethics, but 

74
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,509
we should adopt the viewpoint of aspirational ethics.

75
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:26,310
This new type of ethics

76
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,440
is a subject on Science and Technology Ethics

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,820
I hope you can think about it this way.

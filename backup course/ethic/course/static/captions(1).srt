00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,180
The Seven Step Guide - 1

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,276
We have already discussed about

3
00:00:13,276 --> 00:00:17,429
the ethical issues and the analogy of various problems.

4
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:24,469
With regard to the ethical issues, there is often no single correct solution like there is in Science.

5
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:28,880
Also, we have made sure that there is need for designing the action.

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,960
We now will study how you can setup your ethical design action plan.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,064
Because we will talk about the specific methods of decision-making and so

8
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:45,440
we will be presenting case-studies later in this module.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,420
To make the most out of this learning experiences, please be sure to put yourself in the shoes of persons presented in these cases.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,220
Or, for those people who are currently facing ethical issues,

11
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:08,680
this is a great opportunity for you to think about ways to solve the issues.

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,720
By the way, Prof. Fudano, if there is no one absolute answer as for ethical issues;

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,680
does this mean that there is nothing scientists/engineers can rely upon when making ethical decisions?

14
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,320
Moreover, some people might think that there is no point of thinking about it at all.

15
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,900
I understand where you are coming from.

16
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,640
When it comes to ethical issues, there is no one correct solution as for subjects like Mathematics.

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,920
Even if that is the case, we should be able to point out actions that are ethically reasonable, and,

18
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,780
there are various ways that have been presented to solve ethical issues.

19
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:57,260
In the textbook on engineering ethics, for example, sometimes there is a middle

20
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:07,700
road/route that can be taken. For example, the seven step guide will be introduced.

21
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:15,220
When people face ethical issues,

22
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:21,580
this method has been implemented in many instances.

23
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,860
In addition - this method is considered to be easy to accept, for scientists and engineers.

24
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:35,480
This method, "Seven-step Guide to Ethical Decision-making" was proposed by Prof. Michael Davis at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

25
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,660
We will be making a slight change to his Seven-step guide in this module;

26
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:50,860
we will be using the "KIT version," which was first developed by the Kanazawa Institute of Technology (KIT).

27
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,437
Please take a look at your worksheet.

28
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:58,781
This is the Seven-step Guide.

29
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:04,416
The very first step, step 0, is to

30
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:18,860
put yourself into the shoes of the person facing ethical issues and imagine what you would do if you were s/he.

31
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,260
Once you complete step 0,

32
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:30,540
to clearly state the ethical problem, is step 1.

33
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:42,960
In this step, you should be thinking and stating obstacles that s/he faces regarding the ethical issues.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,600
It is important for you to write down the problem in words.

35
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,820
Step 2 is to identify the facts.

36
00:03:52,860 --> 00:04:05,140
Organizing/reviewing the facts allows you to clarify and avoid assumptions/biases you could possibly have.

37
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:15,800
You should be thinking about the facts, unclear items, or things that have not been mentioned.

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,360
Also - take a look at laws that are relevant to the issues at hand.

39
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:32,760
It can be helpful to take a look at code of ethics of academic societies that are relevant to the issues.

40
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,380
Often the solution may become clear when the central question is

41
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,380
reframed based upon facts and taking a birds-eye viewpoint.

42
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:48,480
Step 3 is to identify the stakeholders and their values, etc.

43
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:57,720
What I mean by "stakeholders" are the people, who will be affected by actions taken, or those people who will affect the actions taken.

44
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,940
It is important for you to consider potential stakeholders you might have in this issue.

45
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,180
You will also need to consider the values that matters to these stakeholders.

46
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:22,580
Looking at step 1 again,  you will also need to see the issue based upon values in Step 3.

47
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:30,800
It is not important to try to distinguish Step 2 and Step 3 at this point.

48
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:40,260
You can go back and forth between the steps and try to evaluate the facts and relevant issues.

49
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:50,460
Also you might want to go back and forth between the Step 2 and Step 3, you can also re-consider Step 1.

50
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:59,160
There is no need for you to complete the steps in chronological order.

51
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,880
After you organize the facts and stakeholders and values, the next step is Step 4.

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,300
In this step, you should list options (they should be as concrete as possible).

53
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,340
Rather than just trying to come up with alternatives

54
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:35,600
gather information you have built thus far, and think about ways to consult (when, to whom) as specific as you can at this point.

55
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,700
You should be coming up with this process as specific as you can, in this step, Step 4.

56
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:49,180
Prof. Michael Davis recommends to come up with at least five different scenarios at this stage.

57
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:55,900
In your worksheet though; please come up with at least four different approaches.

58
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:09,680
Please evaluate options using "ethical tests" in Step 5.

59
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:21,240
I will be explaining to you in detail ethical tests later though; you should be examining the ethical validity of actions through the ethics tests.

60
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:34,580
For instance, reversibility (golden rule) test, universalizability test and related tests.

61
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,120
In addition, there is a test that is examined by a group of experts.

62
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:49,640
There are the tests that can be used as a tool to examine actions.

63
00:07:49,800 --> 00:08:05,840
You should be making a decision based upon the actions to be undertaken and  reviewing Steps 1 through 5, in Step 6.

64
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,160
Based on the evaluation made using the ethical tests in Step 5,

65
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,360
you should be coming up with an action you would want to take.

66
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:23,580
It is fine even if the action you have come up with results from a combination of the steps above,

67
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:33,360
as long as you can explain your approach to experts, is Step 6.

68
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:43,240
Now that the action plan is complete, you might think you are done, however, the next step is Step 7, which is quite important.

69
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:59,260
In Step 7, you should be re-examinning the steps outlined in Steps 1 through 6, thinking about what policies should be undertaken in order to avoid the same ethical problem again and consider how to improve the situation.

70
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:14,060
Sometimes a problem faced by an individual should be looked at from an organization level, the meso level. This is step 7.

71
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,580
I see. It's very specific and a practical approach.

72
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,740
Now that we understand the guide,

73
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,980
we will be explaining each step in detail using a mini case study approach.

74
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,360
Let's do that.

1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
Value and Code of
Ethics of Engineers 2

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
This is Article 1 of
the fundamental

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
canons of ethics
for engineer.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
It is a prominent principle

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
stated in the first line

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
of many code of ethics.

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
It reads:
'Engineers shall hold

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
paramount the safety,
health and welfare

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
of the public in
the performance

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
of their professional duties."

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
Public safety,

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
health, and well-being are

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
the most important values

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
for engineers.

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
At the same time,

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
the Article 4 of
the fundamental

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
canons states that
'engineers shall act

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
in professional matters

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
for each employer or client

20
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
as faithful agents

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
or trustees, (...)'.

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
Code of ethics stipulates

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
many other values.

24
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
For instance, it states

25
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
engineer shall avoid

26
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
conflicts of interest.

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
Many others, such as safety,

28
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
are prescribed in the codes.

29
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
Now, let's look
at the history

30
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
of code of ethics for
engineers in Japan.

31
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
The first code of
ethics in Japan was

32
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
established by a society
of civil engineers

33
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
in 1938.

34
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
It was called as
'the principles and

35
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
code of practices for
civil engineer'.

36
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
It stated engineer's dignity

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
and code of practices.

38
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
Considering it was established

39
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
as early as in 1938,

40
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
it was remarkably
well formulated,

41
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
thanks to the leadership
of Akira Aoyama.

42
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,002
Aoyama was a renowned

43
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
civil engineer worked for

44
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
the Home Ministry.

45
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,011
He became the 23rd president

46
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,014
of Japan Society of Civil

47
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,017
Engineers.

48
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
Influenced by
Kanzo Uchiyama,

49
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,023
Aoyama developed his career

50
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,026
in the United States

51
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,029
and worked on the Panama

52
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
Canal construction.

53
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
Aoki was an
unprecedented engineer

54
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,038
with international
perspective

55
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,041
and practical experience.

56
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,044
Aoki considered
civil engineering as

57
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,980
essential driving force for
the cultural development.

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
Referring to the
examples in the U.S.,

59
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,986
he constituted a noble

60
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,989
and lofty code of ethics.

61
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,992
He proposed the draft

62
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,995
in 1933, which was officially

63
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,998
approved by the society

64
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,001
in 1938. However,

65
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,004
in the time of
chauvinistic nationalism

66
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,007
fueled by the
Sino-Japanese war

67
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,010
and the Pacific war,
Aoki's code of ethics

68
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
did not receive
recognitions,

69
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,016
even in the society
until recently.

70
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,019
The code had

71
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,022
a very limited impact

72
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,025
on Japanese civil engineers.

73
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,028
In 1950's, when Japan entered

74
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,031
the post-war
restoration period,

75
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,034
after the model of
consulting engineer

76
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,037
in the U. S.,
the qualification law

77
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,973
of professional engineer
was established

78
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,976
in Japan in 1957,
with the aim of

79
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,979
putting their
professional skills

80
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,982
for the development of
national industry.

81
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,985
Following the
qualification systems

82
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
such as consulting engineer,

83
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,991
professional engineer

84
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,994
in the U.S. and Europe,

85
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,997
chartered engineer
in the U.K.,

86
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000
the law officially
prescribed

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,003
the specific qualification

88
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,006
for Japanese
consulting engineer.

89
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,009
In 1961,

90
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,012
the Institution of
Professional Engineers

91
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,015
established the
code of ethics

92
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,018
for engineers and
their practices.

93
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,021
This code of ethics,
however,

94
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,024
did not receive
much recognition,

95
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
neither.

96
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,030
Because of the
small number of

97
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,966
qualified engineers,
it didn't

98
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,969
have prevailing impact

99
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,972
to the whole country.

100
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,975
After 80 years since the
establishment in the U.S,

101
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,978
the first modern code
of ethics for

102
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,981
Japanese engineer
was established

103
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,984
in 1996. The international

104
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,987
information science
associations criticized

105
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,990
only societies in
Japan and Korea among

106
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,993
all those in the world
have no code of ethics.

107
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,996
Receiving the pressure from
international community,

108
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,999
the Information Processing
Society of Japan

109
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,002
quickly established
their code of ethics.

110
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,005
As the relationship between

111
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,008
science and society changes,

112
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,011
major scientific societies
and associations

113
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,014
followed to establish
code of ethics,

114
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,017
and revised it regularly.

115
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,020
It is important for you

116
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,023
to read and examine
the code of ethics

117
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,960
prescribed by scientific
societies and associations

118
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,963
in your relevant field,

119
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,966
to study and consider

120
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,969
what kinds of values
are emphasized

121
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,972
in your field of engineering.

    "is said to be Reagan's intention.", 
    "To evade public criticism", 
    "against his education policy,",

    "ended up approving the launch.", 
    "What would you do,", 
    "if you were Mr. Boisjoly?", 
    "1) Respect the final management judgment,", 
    "and simply wish the O-rings", 
    "seal tightly under the low air temperature.", 
    "2) Report the management of NASA", 
    "that the safety is under threat;",

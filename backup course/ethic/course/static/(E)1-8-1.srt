1
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:15,664
Professor, if we classify the story into four levels,

2
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:16,862
Basically it was a story on a Macro level

3
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:17,959
we can think about it that way, except

4
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:20,154
when you think about it on other levels

5
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:22,845
What can we say about it?

6
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:25,039
On a meso level,

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,330
Although this is related to organizations and institutions,

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,510
regarding this point as well, since the 1990s,

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,706
big changes have been occurring.

10
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:39,588
On this matter,

11
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:43,085
information becomes more detailed at this point,

12
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:47,270
so it's better to read it in text format, but

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,559
briefly speaking,

14
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,352
for someone to be an internationally qualified engineer

15
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:55,047
what kind of abilities should this person possess?

16
00:00:55,047 --> 00:01:00,427
These things were discussed in the 1990's,

17
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:04,318
during engineering training, what is always required is

18
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:08,300
the train engineers with technological capabilities.

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,392
This is compulsory training.

20
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:13,882
And the reason, is what we spoke about earlier

21
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:19,164
the engineers make the decisions and

22
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:22,133
judgment, actions and behaviours based on it

23
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:26,827
while it has become a major influence on human society.

24
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:29,320
Ethical judgment ability is also

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,711
something that should be compulsory for internationally qualified engineers.

26
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:35,134
It is a basic ability

27
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:40,123
based upon a common understanding in every country in this world.

28
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:43,531
That is why now, the ethics of the technology

29
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,929
if we question it, should be questioned on a meso level

30
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,918
I think I can say that.

31
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:51,511
Finally, how about at the micro level?

32
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:57,287
This is especially the case for Japan, but in the 1990's,

33
00:01:57,287 --> 00:02:02,777
Along with the previous meso, around the second half of the mid-1990s,

34
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:06,867
In 1995, I'm not sure if you

35
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,256
remember Mr. Kono,

36
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,540
For example, the followers of Aum Shinrikyo

37
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,832
released poisonous gas in the subways,

38
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:21,616
This kind of incident happened.

39
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:28,203
Because of that, well trained people with excellent education

40
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:34,080
injured or killed innocent people using poison gas

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,677
Such terrorist acts were committed.

42
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:41,953
And we want to question why

43
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,850
such an incident occurred.

44
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,244
This was not an isolated incident,

45
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:49,929
Just as you see in this timeline,

46
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:52,724
every year, technical people

47
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:56,814
and their organisations are involved in various incidences,

48
00:02:56,814 --> 00:02:59,111
Such technology ethics,

49
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:02,800
cases related to technology ethics occur frequently.

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,583
This is the ethics of engineers on a micro level,

51
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,163
showing the importance of the engineerâ€™s ethical judgment ability.

52
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:18,644
I believe this is in the background from which we should start our next discussions.

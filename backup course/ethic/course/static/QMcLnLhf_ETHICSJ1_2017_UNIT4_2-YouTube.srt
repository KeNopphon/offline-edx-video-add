1
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:13,774
That means that air pollution had become

2
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:16,294
a serious problem even in Japan at that time,

3
00:00:16,294 --> 00:00:19,172
which led to various regulations.

4
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:23,000
In 1966, the Ministry of Transportation

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,442
had committed to keeping carbon monoxide levels

6
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:32,360
to 3% or less. Then, in 1967,

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,600
The Environmental Pollution Prevention Act​, and in 1968,

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,356
the Air Pollution Control Law was enacted.

9
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:44,837
In 1970, there was an incident in Tokyo involving

10
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,198
a female high school student who collapsed during gym class,

11
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:50,852
which raised widespread awareness about

12
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:53,519
so-called photochemical smog.

13
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:59,067
Now, air pollution from car exhaust may have been

14
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:03,933
a serious problem in Japan at that time,

15
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:07,285
but the situation in the US was even worse.

16
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:12,134
In 1970, the US passed a law called

17
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:16,823
the Clean Air Act Amendments,

18
00:01:16,823 --> 00:01:18,153
also known as the Muskie Act,


19
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:23,045
after Senator Muskie, who drafted it. 


20
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:27,424
There was a Clean Air Act of 1963,


21
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:31,159
but the new law had significantly revised it.


22
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,477
It was an extremely strict law that demanded

23
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:41,957
a 90% decrease in the concentration of harmful substances

24
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:45,489
like the carbon monoxide in car exhaust—that is, 


25
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:52,940
1/10 of the 1970 level—in 5 years’ time.

26
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,457
This regulation gave the car companies of the time—


27
00:01:55,457 --> 00:01:57,215
known in the US as the Big Three—

28
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:02,290
it sent shock waves throughout the auto industry.


29
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,505
As you can imagine, the Big Three that I just mentioned—


30
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:07,555
the industry—responded in a chorus of opposition, 

31
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:11,456
saying that it was technically impossible.

32
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:14,923
So, how do you think Sōichiro HONDA viewed


33
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:17,826
the enactment of the Muskie Act in the US?

34
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:21,182
This is where it gets interesting.

35
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:25,011
Mr. Honda saw it as a business opportunity.


36
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,970
This is because, even though Honda was selling

37
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,730
kei-cars (light cars) at the time,

38
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,148
those kei-cars caused some accidents that resulted in

39
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:39,130
their drivers’ deaths. The company was 

40
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,166
taken to court under the accusation that

41
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:45,412
Honda’s faulty cars were to blame for the accidents.

42
00:02:45,412 --> 00:02:49,828
As a result, Honda’s revenues hit a major slump.


43
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:55,081
It was then that Mr. Honda realized that

44
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:59,819
if he could succeed in developing the low-emission engines

45
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,826
that the world’s leading automakers had deemed impossible,

46
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:08,178
then Honda would be able to rub shoulders with 

47
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:10,855
other automakers. So, Mr. Honda came to oversee


48
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:14,848
the development of a low-emission engine 


49
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:18,855
as a business opportunity, without any connection to

50
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:24,405
environmental values. In February 1971, 

51
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:29,071
he announced that it would be possible to develop

52
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:31,059
an engine that met the requirements of 

53
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:34,875
the Muskie Act, but in reality,

54
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,748
this was nowhere near true at the time. (laughs)

55
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:38,487
(laughs)


56
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:43,347
Now, Sōichiro HONDA was very close with his

57
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:47,937
team of young engineers, who called him Pops.


58
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:51,851
He was always on the factory floor with them,


59
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:57,282
extolling the joys of making things with your own two hands.

60
00:03:57,282 --> 00:04:03,371
But at this point, Mr. Honda thought about what to do


61
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:06,647
not as an engineer, but as a manager.

62
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,942
And as a manager, he decided that, in order to 



63
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:12,801
save the company he built from the crisis 

64
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:16,683
it had found itself in, he would announce 

65
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:19,733
the development of a new engine

66
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:23,216
that met the requirements of the Muskie Act.


67
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:27,363
At the time, people were already thinking 


68
00:04:27,363 --> 00:04:32,297
about the role of engineers, 

69
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:36,606
given that it was not solely Honda’s prerogative,

70
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:41,174
but rather the entire auto industry’s prerogative,



71
00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:46,010
to support engineers working on the project

72
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,884
and to combat air pollution. That is, ask yourself 



73
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:53,032
what you ought to do as an engineer, and act accordingly—


74
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:56,910
one of the ethical principles emphasized in this course.

75
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,644
For the engineers who toiled night and day

76
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:05,126
in Honda’s rigorous R&D environment

77
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:10,751
to help make the project a success, 

78
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:14,093
the development of the CVCC engine was certainly

79
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:16,872
an important event that shaped Honda’s destiny.


80
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:21,777
However, even more than that,


81
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:28,124
it is thought that a major factor


82
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:30,676
in the project’s success was


83
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:34,760
the belief that the development of a low-emission engine


84
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,082
that meets the requirements of the Muskie Act

85
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:41,791
was what engineers can and must do for society.

86
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,524
This sense of duty is expressed by the words of


87
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:48,070
a man named Sho ISHIZUYA, 


88
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,495
who belonged to an air pollution research lab:


89
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:55,440
“Let’s leave clear, blue skies for our children.”

90
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,136
“Clear skies for our children”

91
00:05:58,136 --> 00:06:01,357
was the vision and sense of mission

92
00:06:01,357 --> 00:06:03,087
behind future development projects,

93
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:05,566
which would be overseen


94
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:11,345
not by Sōichiro HONDA himself, 


95
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:15,428
but by a leader named Mr. Tadashi KUME,

96
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:19,243
who was 39 at the time and


97
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:22,721
would later become the president of Honda.


98
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:27,330
So, projects like those that aim to, say, 

99
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,300
make an engine that meets requirements

100
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,309
thought to be impossible by other companies,

101
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:39,673
succeed because the members share a vision

102
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:42,411
that project is not about the company,

103
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:46,195
but rather about the role of engineers in society.

104
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:50,509
That’s why the projects would succeed:

105
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:54,162
There was a shared set of values

106
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:58,620
regarding the purpose of technological development.

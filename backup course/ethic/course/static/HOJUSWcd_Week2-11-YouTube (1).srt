1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
The Value

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,015
So far we examined

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
different stakeholders.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
Next we discuss

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
the notion of 'value'.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
We have seen that 'value'

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
plays significant role

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
in considering the
engineer's ethics.

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
This will be examined
at many stages

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,039
in the following
lectures. Now,

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
'value', what does this
mean actually?

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
Generally, Japanese
dictionaries define

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,048
'value' as a nature or
property that can be object

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
of desire or interest
of humankind,

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
which nevertheless
should be distinct from

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
personal liking and
preference,

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,993
or something useful
and efficient

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,996
to fulfill your purpose.

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,999
In philosophy,
'value' is defined

20
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002
as something that should be
universally approved,

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,005
regardless of
individual preference,

22
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
such as truth,
rightness, and beauty.

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,011
Truth, rightness,
and beauty are

24
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,014
basic elements within
the traditional

25
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,017
classification of value.

26
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,020
Truth is an
intellectual value,

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
and rightness is
a moral value.

28
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
And beauty is an
aesthetic value.

29
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,029
There are many others.

30
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
Value of procedure
is a criterion

31
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,035
for excellence of procedure.

32
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
Religious value is to

33
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,041
judge sacred against evil.

34
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,044
Furthermore,

35
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,047
there's also
commercial value

36
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,050
of products' distribution,

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987
and financial value
of things.

38
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990
Value judgment is

39
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,993
to estimate something

40
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
based on a value system.

41
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,999
Dictionary definition reads:

42
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,002
a value judgment is to judge

43
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
something if it is
good or bad,

44
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,008
or the subjective
decision made

45
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,011
on the basis of a value
classification,

46
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,014
such as truth, rightness,
and beauty.

47
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,017
it is worth noting that

48
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,020
the decision is
'subjective'.

49
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,023
In examining the
engineer's ethics,

50
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,026
it is essential to recognize

51
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,029
the subjectivity
of judgment.

52
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032
Certainly, engineers are

53
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,035
well educated and trained

54
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,038
in objective judgment,

55
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,041
dealing with sharable,.

56
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,044
technical information

57
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,980
such as scientific laws,

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,983
theories, and
experimental data.

59
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,986
On the other hand,

60
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,989
engineers' receptivity are

61
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,992
less cultivated towards

62
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,995
subjective values, such as

63
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,998
cultural and
religious values,

64
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,001
it is just like those of

65
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,004
ordinary people. Inevitably,

66
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,007
therefore, engineers tend to

67
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,010
prioritize objective values.

68
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,013
They can be puzzled,

69
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,016
when asked to make

70
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,019
subjective judgment.

71
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,022
However, as we have
discussed,

72
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,025
engineers' ethics

73
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,028
requires you

74
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,031
to design your action,

75
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,034
with your own judgment,

76
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,037
balancing values,

77
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,973
to lead the best solution.

78
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,976
To have a capacity of
'subjective'

79
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,979
judgment is thus essential

80
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,982
as the basis for
ethical judgment.

81
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,985
This is the reason

82
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,988
why we emphasize

83
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,991
the importance of
various values

84
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,993
in this course.

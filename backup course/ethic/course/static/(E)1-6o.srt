00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,061
Professor,

2
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:15,251
I think that I'm gradually beginning to understand

3
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:16,952
about the issue of ethics in science and technology.

4
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:20,348
But when in practice we are expected to

5
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:21,945
try to make ethical decisions,

6
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:23,341
I wonder what it is

7
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:26,749
that we can actually do to achieve this.

8
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:30,240
In this course,

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,246
although we will look at

10
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:34,439
specific ways to make ethical decisions,

11
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,319
Aside from that, what I always say to everyone

12
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:43,113
is that there are many different ethical theories or approaches.

13
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:47,010
Rather than telling you to think about one specific ethical theory,

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,993
What I am thinking about in principal,

15
00:00:52,993 --> 00:00:56,193
is combining several different ethical theories.

16
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:58,482
What this means is,

17
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:01,583
when considering ethical issues

18
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:06,463
it is better about in relation to time, space, and relationships.

19
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:08,961
What I'm saying is,

20
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:11,063
think about the relations between all of these things.

21
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:15,155
So now let's go through making a decision in this way.

22
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:18,644
For example, regarding time:

23
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:22,829
Normally, when you are forced to make ethical decisions

24
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,821
you are pushed for time, aren't you?

25
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,520
You have to decide by tomorrow...

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,018
You have to decide right now...and so forth.

27
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:33,001
Though it normally happens this way,

28
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:36,302
pausing and taking a moment

29
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:39,099
makes time seem longer than it is.

30
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,691
That is, for example, think about yourself 1 year ago.

31
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:44,893
Would you make the decision in the same way?

32
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:47,384
Or if you imagine yourself a year from now,

33
00:01:47,384 --> 00:01:49,186
how would you make the same decision?

34
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:51,973
Or try and think about this:

35
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:55,777
What would a historian 100 years in the future

36
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:57,966
write about the decision

37
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:00,263
 that you are faced with making now?

38
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:04,054
By approaching things you are trying to do

39
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:05,645
or decisions you are trying to make in this way,

40
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:10,444
you can think it through thoroughly.

41
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:13,032
Whether this action would be appropriate.

42
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,129
Whether it would be ethical.

43
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:20,226
That's my way of thinking about this decision making approach.

44
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:22,318
Though we just spoke about time,

45
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,814
the same applies for space.

46
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:28,413
For example, instead of just thinking about

47
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:30,403
what you are about to do now,

48
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,476
within the confines of Japan...

49
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:36,069
What if you thought about this in the context of Asia as a whole?

50
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:37,871
Or the world?

51
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:42,253
You can expand your thinking in this way.

52
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:46,967
As for relationships,

53
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,739
look at things from the other party's point of view.

54
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,838
Put yourself in their shoes,

55
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,831
How does what I am about to do now

56
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:56,434
appear from the other party's standpoint?

57
00:02:56,434 --> 00:03:00,022
So again, I believe that in this way,

58
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:04,415
you can expand your thinking and relate to the other party.

59
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:08,105
At this point, as it's a rare opportunity,

60
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:13,596
I thought that I would get you to try and expand your thinking

61
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:15,891
in relation to time as much as possible.

62
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:18,088
If you were to expand time to the maximum degree,

63
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:19,482
what do you think it would be like?

64
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,798
To the maximum degree?

65
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:26,048
Instead of just 100 years, how about the start of civilization et cetera.

66
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:27,938
Or even further,

67
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:30,033
try to think about it in relation to the universe,

68
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:33,111
back to the dawn of time itself.

69
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:40,098
In doing so, I think that there are various theories,

70
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:43,398
but generally there was a big bang.

71
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:46,290
There, in that instance time, the universe was born.

72
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,579
Time began.

73
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,283
When did the big bang take place?

74
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:53,775
Again, there are many thoughts regarding this,

75
00:03:53,775 --> 00:04:01,845
but it is often said that the big bang happened

76
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:04,341
about 13.5 billion years ago.

77
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:08,036
But, how about that,13.5 billion years ago…

78
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:10,022
Mr. Kono, can you imagine that?

79
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:10,935
I can't imagine it at all.

80
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:12,228
It's truly unimaginable, isn't it?

81
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:14,121
Although it's a considerable challenge to

82
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,017
think back 13.5 billion years,

83
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:21,001
There are people who have brought forth very interesting ideas

84
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:24,306
on this matter.

85
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:31,591
There was an enlightened American scientist and astronomer

86
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:34,588
by the name of Carl Sagan.

87
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:40,580
This person proposed that we try thinking of the

88
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,775
13.5 billion years of the universe,

89
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:46,162
condensed to a single year.

90
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:53,251
So, at 0 hours, 0 minutes and 0 seconds when the

91
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,758
the big bang happened, and the universe

92
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:59,141
and time was born.

93
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:05,435
That is to say, we should think of right now as

94
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:08,229
x hours, y minutes and z seconds from the Universe’s New Year's Day.

95
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:11,124
Scaling 13.5 billion years to a single year.

96
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:18,307
Having done that, what of Earth?

97
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:22,001
When do you think the Earth that we're living on was born?

98
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:26,705
Does the earth have an autumn? A winter?

99
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:30,079
It is said that the Earth

100
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,275
was born around September 14th.

101
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:36,467
By the way, one second of the Cosmic Calendar is

102
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:39,861
equal to about 475 years in real time.

103
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:41,056
That's just one second.

104
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:43,474
Right, just one second.

105
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:49,364
Life began on the earth at the end of September.

106
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:52,246
So, how long do you think it was

107
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:56,048
until humans were born?

108
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:58,434
Around December? You could say that.

109
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:01,433
It was on New Year's Eve.

110
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:05,822
By about 10:30 on the evening of December 31st,

111
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:08,625
human life began.

112
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,507
So now, when do you think the science and technology we are thinking about right now

113
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:17,503
came to life?

114
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,700
It's already 11pm now, so...

115
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,391
Well, after all,

116
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:27,978
modern science was born in the eras of Galileo and Newton.

117
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:32,281
So that would be the 16th and 17th centuries.

118
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:34,371
If you put that into the context of the Cosmic Calendar,

119
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:37,276
It was about 1 second ago.

120
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:42,761
So, now, many people are working flat-out,

121
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:45,952
from morning till night, getting to grips with the science and technology

122
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:50,053
which encompass our world.

123
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:54,142
Because in the scheme of the Cosmic Calendar,

124
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:55,638
science and technology were born

125
00:06:55,638 --> 00:06:58,913
less than a fraction of a second ago.

1
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:16,757
Now, imagine the following scenario.

2
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:19,185
You studied environmental sciences

3
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,048
and you have just got your postgraduate diploma.

4
00:00:22,048 --> 00:00:24,876
So now you're fresh out of university.

5
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:28,359
You applied to a renowned company in your hometown

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,321
and managed to get a job there.

7
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:35,122
You're this freshly-hired employee.

8
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:37,922
As for your parents, with you being their only child,

9
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:41,456
having you work close to home

10
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:44,191
is a really good thing.And you

11
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,339
are satisfied with your job at the company.One day...

12
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,233
your manager tells you to stay for overtime.

13
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,215
You go to a storeroom as you are told.

14
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:56,546
And in there you see a steel drum. You do not know what is inside.

15
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:58,897
Your manager tells you to empty the drum

16
00:00:58,897 --> 00:01:02,450
into a nearby river.

17
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,553
He forbids you from

18
00:01:05,553 --> 00:01:08,042
asking what's inside the drum.But...

19
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:11,892
You can't help thinking that

20
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:14,814
it may be something harmful to the environment.Still...

21
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:18,101
Do you dare go against your manager's orders?

22
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:22,105
Knowing it will turn him against you?

23
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:24,594
You were so lucky landing this job.

24
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:27,926
So you'd rather not risk it over this.On the other hand...

25
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:31,105
As a professional,

26
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:33,612
you doubt whether this is right.Nevertheless,

27
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:37,027
the manager spoke to you in a very strict manner

28
00:01:37,027 --> 00:01:39,055
and you're leaning towards doing as he says.

29
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:41,657
So this is the situation you're in.

30
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:45,302
Try to picture yourself faced with this difficult decision.

31
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:49,634
How do you act?

32
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:51,637
Consider this scenario

33
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:54,108
referring to the Seven Step Guide.

34
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:57,689
And think about your response.

35
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,478
You should have a worksheet on your desk.

36
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:05,347
Go to step 0.

37
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:08,553
It's not about right or wrong. Write what you think.

38
00:02:08,553 --> 00:02:10,576
How you would act

39
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:14,089
in the presented situation.No need to overthink it.

40
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:16,400
It's okay to rely on your intuition.

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,177
We will come back to this step later.
